The source for Tech Buying Advice. More Car Tech. Tech deals, prizes and latest news. Introducing the successor to the Nokia Lumia 635. With a 5-inch 720p screen, quad-core processor, strong battery life and excellent camera the Lumia 640 is Windows Phone's answer to the Moto G. For friends, family and everyone in general, you'd have real trouble doing better than this.. The Microsoft Lumia 640 is among the first in a new breed of Windows Phones. With a larger screen, more RAM and a different design language from its predecessor, this is Microsoft stamping its logo (literally) on the Lumia range. And what a change this proves to be.. The old Nokia did things a little differently. Budget devices made by the Finnish firm were notoriously bare-bones; this could be seen in the decision to omit Gorilla Glass and limit RAM in models such as the Lumia 520 and 630 , among others.. Value was added for the consumer through access to services such as MixRadio and HERE Maps. Microsoft takes something of a different tack.. Those who purchase a Microsoft Lumia 640 will receive several sweeteners, such as 30GB of free OneDrive storage and a one-year subscription to Office 365. These in themselves are nice, especially for the price. However, when paired with a phone that rivals (and exceeds) the ever-popular Moto G in many areas, even in its newer incarnation, heads will start to turn.. When it comes to specs, the Microsoft Lumia 640 does not disappoint. The device has a 5-inch, 720p screen with 294 PPI, a quad-core Snapdragon 400 processor clocked at 1.2 GHz, 1GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage. These are exceptionally healthy specifications for the £130, $250 (around AU$320) SIM-free price point.. Though these specifications might appear exceptional, the competition is quite fierce. Devices such as the Honor Holly , Moto G (2014) and EE Kestrel all offer unique advantages at the same price point, while also being able to access the more than one million apps available on the Google Play Store.. As such, the question is, can an Office and OneDrive subscription sell the Microsoft Lumia 640? Will this be the budget hero device that Windows Phone needs?. When I received the Microsoft Lumia 640, I was not especially impressed. My review device was constructed of a glossy cyan plastic, which was unpleasantly reminiscent of older Samsung devices.. I don't have the greasiest fingers in the world, however after five minutes of using the Lumia 640, it looked as if I had wiped it with a pepperoni pizza.. Luckily, the back cover of the device is removable, allowing you to switch in a number of different options, meaning (mercifully) that matte covers are available for those who might want them, along with other suitably 'Lumia' options, including black and orange.. Coming from a smaller device, as I had, it took a little while before I was confident enough to use the phone one-handed. The glossy plastic back meant the phone had a tendency to skate across tables with reckless abandon, so a case might be a wise investment for some.. Though well-balanced in the hand, the shell itself does not feel especially sturdy. Coming from a device such as the Lumia 435, which could sink a ship, the Lumia 640 LTE does not impress overly.. Looking at the side of the device, the black of the inner portion was clearly visible through the plastic, looking as though it might crack easily were it to fall.. Once the back has been removed, access is given to the Micro-SIM slot, the removable 2500mAh battery and the MicroSD slot, which takes cards up to 128GB in size.. The sides of the Lumia 640 LTE are clean and uncluttered, and in the traditional Lumia fashion everything of note is thrown to the right of the phone. No sharp edges are to be found, and using this phone either one- or two-handed is a pleasant and comfortable experience.. The power button and the volume rocker have a decent travel and a nice click to them, meaning everything is easy to find.. A single Micro-USB slot is tidied away on the bottom of the device, while the ever so slightly roughly hewn 3.5mm headphone jack is on the top, as might be expected.. On the back of the Lumia 640, there is a single rear-firing speaker, a neatly displayed Microsoft logo, a single LED flash and the 8MP rear-facing camera.. The front of the device contains the 5-inch screen, a 0.9MP selfie camera and the usual additions of a call-speaker and microphone. With Gorilla Glass covering the front panel, the oleophobic coating immediately makes itself known, feeling very pleasant to the touch.. Overall, this is a utilitarian but nice device for the price. Though Microsoft doesn't take any great gambits with the design, the phone is light, well balanced and pleasant to use both one- and two-handed.. Next Page Key features.

Ask a Question Start a Discussion. Tell us about your experience with our site. I have just bought a sim free Microsoft Lumia 640 LTE (handset only) from CarphoneWharehouse UK. I have subsequently been informed that the phone will only accept UK sim cards but not foreign sim cards despite the phone being sim free. this since most countries operate the same GSM dual band frequencies of 900 and 1800 mhz. that Samsung smartphones sold in the UK will now. Can anyone enlighten me further on this and if its true, the reason. why a UK sim free handset will not operate with a foreign sim card of the same frequencies.. I have the same question (1). ---------------------------------------------------------------- "Remember that a lone amateur built the Ark. A large group of professionals built the Titanic.". Have you actually tried a non-EU SIM card in the phone ?. In reply to 93tid's post on January 12, 2016. No, I don,t have a foreign sim card to try. Buy online, pick up in store.

Microsoft Lumia 640 LTE - user opinions and reviews. Pages: 1 2 3 … 63 64 ». Update to Windows 10, works well and gets updates. im brought in 11 sept 2017 refund it back for seller in 21 sept 2017 about screen issue. Im never trust again microsoft and this comment section in lumia 640 is lies.. I've been using this phone for 2 years and I must say that it has its pro and cons. Pro: it has a good hardware for its price; good camera, good speakers, the screen is HD 720p with very bright and beautiful colors also very resistant, the battery is pretty decent 2,500 mah, nfc conexion, I mean is not bad at all for its price. Cons: I believe everyone thinks the same, I don't like Windows Phone 10, it's just because it's a very poorly optimized OS, applications crashes everytime, a lot of lag, almost there's no applications in the Microsoft Store, ... If we could install Android on this phone, everything would be different, or at least DEVELOPERS try to spend more time in solving those errors in order to users can be still using this beauty phone.. a good phone but I don't like the way its front camera is, why was it made at 1mp? its not worth the phone at all.. There are good and bad points.Budget phone with excellent screen and camera, removable battery, long stand by,OneDrive, Excel, OneNote, Office Lens, Word. Outlook is good for both Email,Calendar.Calls are very clear. Windows 10 installation and subsequent updates require 2 - 3 GB of phone memory, meaning moving apps and photos to SD card to allow updates to install. W10 has removed Here maps with choice of male navigation voice (so much for gender equality),FM radio and revised the keyboard with the "Blue" dot, ok when you get the hang of it. Alarm clock still does not boot up the phone. And Driving Mode with in Car Bluetooth is a farce, there isn't a Hands Free Auto Answer. All Nokia Bluetooth phones have that function, the program as provided is not road legal, you have to touch phone to Answer a call which is breaking the law. So, good and not bad points.

Then choose the apps you want to show in the lock screen (you can choose up to 5). Had to use this thing at work because company didn't had better phones (they didn't want to pay much). And this is absolute frustration at it's finest. its a list, so it takes you forever to find something. Bugs with Bing search, crashings of more or less all apps. Home button directly under space button on keyboard, so you keep exiting from app whenever you are texting, and it takes this phone FOREVER to load anything - especially Whatsapp. Cheap plastic body, clicking sounds from phone while you use it, bad screen, bad camera, bad speakers... most trustrating phone I ever used.

The Lumia 640 is Microsoft latest midrange Lumia phones that is an evolution of the Nokia 630/635 released last year. The design follows the Lumia 635 trend by coming with a coloured plastic back available in either orange, cyan, black or white and have to say I rather like the bright orange colour. The 640 is bigger than the 635, it has a 5 inch screen running at 1280 x 720 which has a sharp look and good colour balance, and it is very much like the more expensive Lumia 735. With the 640 having a larger display it feels thinner and a better design than the 635. I don't think it actually is thinner but it does feel a more elegant device than the older devices. It is powered by a quad core 1.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon processor and as Windows Phone has low processor requirements the phone is very snappy and responsive. Switching between apps is very fast and it plays games like Minecraft very well. It has 1GB of RAM so it will play any of the larger Windows Phone games and the extra ram helps with the speed of loading big apps like the Microsoft Health app which loads much faster on the 640 than the 512mb 635. It has 8GB of on-board storage which is expandable via a MicroSD card which Windows Phone handles really well. There is a microUSB port for charging (no wireless charging, for that you need to step up to a 735), headphone port on the top with the only buttons being power and a volume rocker. There is no dedicated camera button which is a shame and the Back, Windows and Search buttons are the on screen type that pop up when needed or you can swipe up to bring them in view. There is an 8MP rear camera with an LED flash and takes some pretty good shots as you can see. There is also a front camera for selfies and using with Skype. Another nice feature is the Glance screen. This shows you the time, battery status and unread email when the phone is off using a special low power mode. You can have it stay on all the time, turn off after 15 minutes or use peek which turns off after 30 seconds but turns back on with movement. Also on the phone is double tap to wake, you just double tap on the screen and it turns on something my Lumia 1520 has and is really handy as it saved your fumbling for a power button. The Lumia 640 comes with Windows Phone 8.1 Update 2 which adds Bluetooth keyboard support and categorised settings, other than that I couldn't see any other changes from Windows Phone 8.1 Update 1. Battery life is excellent, there is a 2500mAh battery which I found gave you well over two day between charges, more like three days. It supports 3G and 4G and you get 1 year Office 365 Personal edition included. So overall I really like the Lumia 640, for £169.99 SIM free (at the Microsoft Store) or £129.99 at Carphone warehouse you get a feature packed phone that has great battery life, decent camera and a pleasing design. Oh and you will be able to run Windows 10 on it when it is released later this year. If the 5 inch 640 isn't big enough there is a 640 XL available which has the same spec but with 5.7 inch screen and 13 MP camera which costs around £184.98. In this video I take a look at the 640 and put it through its paces.. When autoplay is enabled, a suggested video will automatically play next..

Great instructions and a great design from Nokia. Hi all, thanks for the very helpful instructions. I have one question about my phone though, which is that the glass screen is broken but the digitizer and LCD display are both fine. I’m planning on only buying the glass screen and digitizer combination as I know the LCD display will cost more. My question therefore is whether the LCD display is glued permanently onto the digitizer and glass screen? If it is, this would defeat the point of buying the digitizer and glass screen combination, and I’d have to opt for the triplet of LCD screen, digitizer, and glass screen. I can’t find any sources of information around on the net, and would really appreciate everyone’s kind help and thoughtful advice. Please kindly help, thank you so much!!! :). can anyone help or know anything about this?. <iframe id="dozuki-embed-56161" src="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/embed/56161/full" width="800" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></iframe>. <iframe src="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/embed/56161" width="800" height="584" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></iframe>.

It is interesting to see how far phone screens have progressed in the budget range. Whereas a few years ago, spending less than £200, $300 on a smartphone doomed you to excessive pixelation, now things are very different.. The Moto G (2013) wowed the world with a 720p screen at a less than flagship price several years ago, and now the Lumia 640 joins the club.. With a 5-inch panel, the Lumia 640 certainly sports a comfortable amount of real-estate on which to consume media and play games.. And at 294 PPI, though not quite 'Retina' in its quality, the screen should please everyone (pixel peepers aside). Web browsing was an enjoyable experience, as was viewing HD video.. In the best Lumia tradition, the abilities of the Microsoft Lumia 640's panel do not end there. As mentioned, the Gorilla Glass protection makes using the device a very easy experience.. The nice 'ClearBlack' polarisation filter used previously by Nokia has been applied, meaning that the device has very nice black levels for an LED screen; this makes it easy to use outdoors.. As it is an IPS panel, viewing angles are also excellent. Unusually, for a budget device, the Lumia 640 LTE sports both double-tap to wake and the ever-useful Glance mode, which is configurable to allow for a number of different notifications to appear.. Automatic brightness is also a nice addition, seeing as this was omitted on the Lumia 630; this makes daily use a little easier, while extending the battery a little.. Nokia always had a strong reputation for the quality of the panels it produced, and if this is anything to go by, Microsoft intends to continue the tradition in style. The screen on the Lumia 640 LTE is one of its main highlights, and is easily one of the best available at this price point.. Since Satya Nadella became CEO in 2014, Microsoft has made a strong play for its cloud services. Lumia owners have long had access to Office and OneDrive; however, with the Lumia 640 Redmond has made its strongest push.. Included with the Lumia 640 LTE is a free one-year subscription to Office365 and 30GB of free OneDrive storage. On paper, this is an enormous saving, and it definitely adds value to the device.. OneDrive is certainly a pleasure to use. I found that pictures I took uploaded to the cloud with a minimum of fuss, easily beating Dropbox for speed.. The same was true when accessing files online; the service was consistent and functional, if not remarkable in any regard.. It has long been a necessity for Windows Phone owners to deal with OneDrive in one form or another if they wished to make use of cloud storage, and with 30GB free it is likely that many more will make the jump.. As for the Office 365 subscription, this is where things become a little more difficult. If you are a business owner, the ability to easily sync Word, Excel and Powerpoint files, along with editing them on the go, will no doubt be attractive.. For the average user, however, productivity is as sexy as ever, but Excel will most likely struggle to sell phones. Despite this, it is a nice addition. The Office app for Windows Phone is laid out sensibly and has a number of basic editing options, which remain a little more advanced than their Android and iOS counterparts.. Though typing a 3,000-word essay on a 5-inch screen is as attractive a proposition as ever, for basic tasks on the go, it is more than sufficient. As Microsoft clearly wishes to demonstrate, this is a phone for business as well as pleasure. However, the divide can sometimes be a little too stark.. The Microsoft Lumia 640 and the Lumia 640 XL are the first devices to arrive toting the latest update for Windows Phone – the drably titled Windows Phone 8.1 Update 2.. Typically, when Windows Phone has been updated, exciting names have been dreamt up, and with the new software came a number of new features. Yet, with Windows 10 on its way later in the year, all focus has been diverted to the task at hand, and this latest update has suffered as a result.. Windows Phone 8.1 Update 2 brings with it a number of bug fixes and stability improvements, and one feature that has been missing from Windows Phone from the start: the ability to pin setting options to the Home screen.. In the past, users had to be content either arranging and using the notification tray or swiping through to the settings menu if they wished to access options such as Wi-Fi or mobile data. Aside from a few third-party app options that could solve the problem partially, this could mean on occasion that using Windows Phone was a pain.. As such, I immediately pinned brightness, Wi-Fi and mobile data to the Home screen, which made general use far easier. Windows Phone 8.1 Update 2 also comes with a rearranged setting menu.. Windows Phone no longer has an endless list of random settings, and different options are grouped according to their functions.. I am something of a Windows Phone veteran, and I found these changes all much to my liking. And though newcomers to the mobile OS may find these changes to be simple common sense, they will most likely be welcome nonetheless, making this a quiet triumph.. What is there to say about Cortana that has not already been said?. Microsoft's virtual assistant has been available for Windows Phone owners in the UK since the rollout of the Lumia Denim update in late 2014/early 2015, and it is safe to say that she has been met with a mostly positive reception.. Combining some of the personality of Siri with some of the pre-cognisance of Google Now, along with a little Microsoft secret sauce, Cortana is generally a pleasure to use.. Cortana can perform web searches, compose messages, create reminders – everything that has become the bread and butter of voice assistants everywhere.. In addition to this, she can also interact with select third-party apps, although this function must be baked in by developers, and as such support is somewhat limited at present.. Everything Cortana knows about you is bundled into her 'notebook', which also contains a list of all of her permissions. Here, in a nice departure from the relatively opaque confines of Google Now and Siri, it is easy to control the information that Cortana can access about you.. Though it isn't possible with the Lumia 640 LTE to turn on 'always listening' voice activation, as it is with the likes of the Nokia Lumia 930 and the Lumia 1520 , by pinning a tile to the Home screen, I found Cortana to be useful.. Though she is limited to searching through Bing, Cortana is fast becoming the big-value add-on that Microsoft so clearly wishes the service to be.. Prev Page Introduction and design.

Microsoft Lumia 640 LTE Review: A Very Affordable LTE Windows Phone. Microsoft / Mobile / Mobile Reviews / Reviews / Tech / Windows Phone. Posted on July 11, 2015. (~295ppi) IPS LCD display Qualcomm MSM8926 Snapdragon 400 Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7. Processor 8GB Storage 1GB RAM Rear 8MP (3264×2448) camera;. Front 1MP MicroSD expansion slot expandable up to 128GB Sensors:. accelerometer, proximity, compass, sensor core 2500 mAh battery Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n with hotspot, Bluetooth 4.0, microUSB 2.0, NFC FM Radio microSIM card slot GSM/HSPA/LTE Key Differences Design Display Software Speakers Performance Cameras Reception/Call Quality Battery Life Price/Value Wrap Up *We were sent a demo unit of the Microsoft Lumia 640. for the purposes of this review.. A couple months ago we reviewed Microsoft’s Lumia 640 XL , a large screen Windows Phone without the big price tag. We’ve been using the smaller sibling. for the past few weeks now and see how it compares in our Lumia 640 LTE review.. Before we get into the 640 review, I just wanted to go over a few of the key differences between the 640 XL and the 640 LTE. For starters, the 640 features a 5″ screen as opposed to the 5.7″. on the 640 XL, both are 720p screens however so you get a higher ppi on the 640 (~295 vs ~259). Given that I didn’t notice the lower resolution on the 640 XL after extended use, it definitely wasn’t an issue on the 640 either. While both feature a Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex- A7 Processor, the 640 we reviewed had the 8926 allowing for LTE reception, while the 640 XL we reviewed had the 8226 which doesn’t support LTE. Even though we didn’t review the LTE version of the 640 XL, it is. Being a bigger phone, the 640 XL came with a 3000mAh battery while the 640 sports a smaller 2500mAh battery. The last major difference is in the camera. The 640 XL features a 13MP (4128×3096) back and a 5MP front camera, while the 640 features a smaller resolution 8MP (3264×2448) back and 1MP front camera. Both devices do take 1080p video. There are a few minor design differences like the placement of the LED flash and speaker, but I’ll discuss those later.. As far as price goes, the 640 XL can be found for around $225USD and the 640 for as low as $100USD.. The Lumia 640 LTE features a 5″ screen.. The Microsoft Lumia 640 has the same clean and non-descript design as the 640 XL (so you’ll have to pardon me if this bit sounds familiar). The screen is still set slightly above the body of the phone, and the entire. one plastic piece which comes off to access the SIM slot, microSD slot, and battery. The power and volume buttons sit on the right side of the phone, with the power button almost dead center. While the placement of the power button works great for one handed use on the larger 640 XL, I found my thumb now rested on the volume buttons and had to slide it down to access the power button. In my opinion though, this is a slightly better set up as you’re more likely to use your volume buttons as opposed to the power button in most situations.. The microUSB port is at the bottom of the phone and the headphone jack sits right in the middle of the top of the phone. The rear camera sits centered on the back of the phone near the top and juts out slightly with the LED flash to the left of it, while the single. down in the bottom right of the phone when looking at the back. The Microsoft logo is also stamped across the back, and the Microsoft wordmark appears on the top of the front of the phone solidifying the Microsoft branding.. Our demo unit was bright orange, but it is also available in white, black, or blue.. The screen on the Lumia 640 has a slightly higher ppi than the 640 XL due to it’s smaller screen size. For the most part, the screen is crisp and very readable when viewed at a normal distance. The text in some apps, like IM+ definitely looked a bit jagged though, especially when looking at it closely. I had no issues in viewing the screen in various lighting conditions and angles, the colours are rich and bright and there are four preset display modes (standard, vivid, cool, and advanced) which allow you to set up the colour temperature, tint, and saturation of your phone the way you want it.. As expected, Windows Phone 8.1 ran just fine on the Lumia 640. I’ve always found the Windows Phone OS to be easy to navigate and nicely flows between screens and apps. The Live Tiles, Microsoft’s version of widgets, display relevant information for specific apps that support it, and being able to add, remove, position, and resize the home screen tiles allow you to customize your home screen to your liking.. While the settings page in Windows Phone 8.1 is streamlined by being broken down into categories, as mentioned in the 640 XL review it’s still one big list. After a bit of reading and research and determining that the Windows 10 Mobile Insider Preview wasn’t going to brick the phone, I took a chance and tried that out as well. The biggest thing I noticed was a big clean up and redesign in the settings section, a lot of the same section headers that appear in the 8.1 settings are now actual sections that collapse and expand when selected which really cleans up a lot of the space used in the settings, and more importantly makes it easier to find and access the settings you need.. And the elephant in the room… lack of Windows Phone apps. To be honest, the more I use Windows Phone devices, the less I miss the Google apps like Google+ and for the most part I’ve been able to get by with the offerings in the Windows Store. It was a welcome side effect when I went camping and had no access to group Hangouts and only web access to Google+ as my phone wasn’t constantly notifying me of new messages and posts. That being said, it’ll be interesting to see just how Android and iOS apps will run on Windows 1o Mobile .. Microsoft moved the speaker on the Lumia. 640 LTE to the lower right of the back of the phone and as a result, the sound on the device is a bit better than the 640 LTE. but still not all that great, and suffers even more when placed on a flat surface as it’s then covered by the surface. When listening to music, I found that. I’d have to place the phone face down for best sound results which. required extra steps to check the track or switch to a new one.. I didn’t have any issues with any apps or games I tried out, and as with other Windows phones the interface is very responsive and flows nicely. Some “heavier” games did take a while to load up, like Hungry Shark Evolution but once it was loaded it ran just fine.. Video playback was fine as well with no stuttering on both local videos and when online streaming.. I was pleased to see the Zeiss stamp on the back of the 640 XL, and a bit disappointed to see it missing from the 640 LTE. As mentioned above though, the Lumia 640 LTE has an 8MP back camera as opposed to the 13MP camera on the 640 XL and given that it is at least $100 cheaper than the 640 XL it makes sense that. some corners were cut and the camera was one of them. That being said, the Lumia Camera app is. quick and responsive, and both indoor and outdoor images turned out pretty. decent for an 8MP smartphone camera..

Unedited 100% cropped image taken with Lumia 640 LTE outdoors.. I had no issues with reception in my area, or even while camping out of town.. Call quality on the Lumia 640 LTE. was clear and there were no issues on either end of the call as far as clarity and volume is concerned.. Like the 640 XL, the 640 has outstanding battery life, even with the slightly smaller 2500mAh battery – which makes sense given the screen on the 640 LTE is almost 3/4 of an inch smaller. I consistently got just under 2 days of battery life with normal use which definitely made it a great device when out on the road and while camping.. LTE can be found for as low as $130USD. off contract, which is a great price. While the screen is only 720p, the smaller screen size does give it just under 300 ppi so most apps and text looks pretty crisp. Couple the price with a better than average camera and outstanding battery life and the value for the price is definitely there.. The Lumia 640 LTE is a great and affordable budget phone with a decent screen and outstanding battery life and great performance. If you’re looking for a budget or starter phone, and have been considering a Windows Phone, you’ll want to consider the Lumia 640 – especially with Windows 10 Mobile due out later this year..
