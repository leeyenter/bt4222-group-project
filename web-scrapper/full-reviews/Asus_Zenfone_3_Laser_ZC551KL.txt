Asus ZenFone 3 Laser (ZC551KL): Pricing and Specs in the Philippines. ASUS has released the camera-centric ZenFone 3 Laser to the Philippine market at a great price.. ASUS has more than doubled down with its ZenFone 3 line this year, and it seems like ASUS has a little something for every portion of the market. The ZenFone 3 Laser occupies a peculiar point in the ZenFone lineup. It's a little above the ZenFone 3 Max, but below the regular ZenFone 3, and it has a surprising focus: photography.. The ZenFone 3 Laser has a 5.5-inch Full HD 1080p display protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 4. It has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 chipset, with 4GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, a microSD slot for expansion, and a 13-megapixel main camera with laser autofocus, f/2.0 aperture, and dual LED flash. The front camera is 8-megapixels and has an aperture of f/2.0.. While the processor is nothing to write home about, the ZenFone 3 Laser likes to emphasize its laser autofocus, which is unusual for an entry-level smartphone. The Sony IMX214 sensor used in the main camera is also a cut above what you'd expect at this price range, with ultra-fast 0.03s focusing and 3-axis EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization). ASUS also managed to add in a fingerprint scanner, which is standard in all its ZenFone 3 variants.. The rest of the phone offers the usual perks, including a micro USB port, GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth, Dual SIM support and a 3,000mAh battery. The phone comes with Android 6.0 Marshmallow and ASUS' homebrewed ZenUI 3.0.. The variant above with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage hits the market with an official price of PHP 11,995 and comes in Glacier Silver and Sand Gold.. Usually, in the budget level, the smartphone cameras are not very good, but ASUS is looking to change that with this phone. While it's a little expensive for an entry-level smartphone at this price, it's hard to find a camera of this caliber in a smartphone at this price range.. About ASUS ZenFone 3 Laser ZC551KL. ASUS ZenFone 3 Laser ZC551KL: Is this the Best Mid-Ranging Smartphone?. Chic Metal Body and an Excellent Display:. High-Value Fingerprint Sensor – A 0.3-second fast 360-degree 5-finger recognition comes in at the rear end below the camera. Internal Storage – The 4GB RAM configuration couples with a 64 GB internal storage although there is a 2 GB RAM and 32 GB storage configuration available. Extendable storage maximizes at 128 GB via microSD cards. Android Version – This device will come with an Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow inside it. But users will get a complimentary Android 7.0 Nougat update. Powerful Battery – A 3000 mAh juices this device. Expected run times are at 20 hours of 3G talk time and 12 hours of video playback. ZenUI 3.0 – Adding more value to this ASUS ZenFone 3 Laser ZC551KL is ASUS's in-house Zen User Interface. It works over the stock Android for additional UI and UX value. ASUS ZenFone 3 Laser ZC551KL Philippines Market Review:. ASUS ZenFone 3 Laser ZC551KL has an excellent camera setup, strong ergonomic performance, detailed display and a lot more. In comparison to the mid-ranging price tag, this has high-valeu-for-money. This 13MP rates as one of the best rear camera setups in this range and this comes from users-experts alike. It comes with an f/2.0 aperture, a 1/3-inch Sony camera sensor, a stand-alone RGB sensor (Color Correction) and EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization).. This is one of the very few shooters in this range which comes with a 0.03 second fast Laser-Assist Auto-Focus. Improvements with this 2nd gen state-of-the-art AF include 3 times coverage distance and excellent low light functionalities.. The EIS ups the output with a 3-axis balance and 6-direction compensation. Quite obviously, this rear setup scores high on 'In-motion' stills and 1080p HDR recordings.. ASUS takes all of this even further by adding their in-house PixelMaster 3.0 at the back-end.. The results are amazing without doubt. The RGB and Sony camera sensor takes color vibrancy and hue depth beyond what users might expect from a 13 MP setup. Framing and depth-of-field are immediately noticeable.. But the surprise actually is thanks to PixelMaster 3.0. Deep Trench Isolation as ASUS calls it allows this setup to take Super Resolution (4 times the normal Resolution) 52 MP quality stand-out stills. With Real-Time HDR, users can make the best of this tech in case of motion pictures as well.. To sum it up, this is one of the best setups in this price range.. ASUS ZenFone 3 Laser ZC551KL has a 8MP Front Selfie Camera with brilliant picture setup and functions. If the 84-degree field of view and f/2.0 aperture does not win buyers then the PixelMaster 3.0 working behind it surely will.. This is an intelligent setup with the Beautification mode automatically kicking in by default. One of the few front shooters which comes with laser Focus, it can take excellent selfies in low light conditions too with plenty of customizations post-capture to get the best selfies.. An all-metal body, ASUS ZenFone 3 Laser ZC551KL has exquisite curves all round shaping slowly to a flat rear end. The 7.9mm thin sides and 150 gram feather-weight makes this an exceptionally compact and attractive design.. The silk ribbon for the whole package is a vividly engrossing 5.5-inch IPS LCD FHD display with a 2.5D Corning Gorilla Glass 3 on top. Display resolution comes in at 1920 x 1080 pixels with a 401 PPI (Pixels Per Inch) and a class-leading 500 nits brightness. This is one of the best value-for-money displays not only in this range but in the whole smartphone industry.. Simply, users get a top-end display module with vibrant colors and increasingly deep shades for a mid-range price tag.. A Qualcomm MSM8937 Snapdragon 430 series chipset with an Octa-core Cortex-A53 setup powers this device. It couples with an Adreno 505 GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) and a huge 4 GB RAM. Single-Core clock speeds come in at 1.4 GHz.. But where this device scores high is in multi-core performance. Seamless tasks or functions along with moderate FHD gaming is an obvious expectation.. Philippines are one of the most important markets for ASUS. And this device is available throughout Philippines both off-line and online. A bargain price-tag in comparison to the features inside, ASUS ZenFone 3 Laser ZC551KL does look to sale to the top of the sheets.. Reviews of ASUS ZenFone 3 Laser ZC551KL. User Review : 8 Reviews.

ASUS ZenFone 3 Laser ZC551KL Reviews. 5.5 inch display and very lightweight (150 g) smartphone powered by Android 6.0 with brand-new ASUS ZenUI OS, 1.4 GHz 64-bit Quad Core Processor Snapdragon 430 CPU, 32GB main storage and 13 MP main camera. 5.5 inches, FHD (1920 x 1... 2G, 3G, 4G (LTE), 32GB, 6... Please feel free to post your review on this product.. CPU (Soc) and RAM are not well-balanced?. It is up to each person's taste. It feels slippery to me, and it feels cold because it is made of metal and because I got it in winter.. It doesn't fit in some pockets.. It only has volume button, power button and fingerprint reader, so it is not that bad once you get used to it.. Preinstalled ATOK seems to be older version or cheap edition; it is a bit silly. I have purchased paid version of ATOK, so I disabled the preinstalled one and am using the one I bought.. But it gets heavy when I use heavy apps or start websites with many pictures.. It is good if you like ASUS's original menu.. It has ordinary tone of colors.. I have no problems so far. I have experienced no inconvenience for hearing so far.. Sound quality is average, but it sounds loud.. It doesn't last as long as I expected. It has many settings for it, but the battery life is not so good.. With other device, when it was fully charged in the morning, it had about 60% left at night. With this one, on the other hand, it gets less than 50 % and is about to be 40%. I am using it in the same way as my other device.. It is supposed to have 4GB RAM, but it is about 3.5GB in reality. Also, because CPU is not powerful, it is not good for playing games. Though it has big RAM, CPU is not powerful; it is like you can put many files on your desk (RAM) but takes time to find ones you need (CPU).. As for camera, AF is fast, but the image quality is not so good... I haven't been able to take any photos I find beautiful... Well, maybe I shouldn't expect too much for a mid-range device.. I haven't had any particular problems so far, but I felt its performance is actually not so good.. This price for this performance is good enough. At first, I was muddled with some area, and I though it was not easy to use.. For example, it has ZenFone's original keyboard, and app menu are not shown, so I got muddled and couldn't change apps in the way I like.. But it can be changed to flick input when you change the setting, and you can change the hidden apps to be shown.. I changed a lot from its initial setting, but because I made it in the way I like, now I can use it pleasantly.. Earphone kept falling out and it was such a put off, but if you put it deeply, it fits all the way.. You may feel unhappy with it till you get used to it, but while using it, you will start to see its advantages.. It is not perfect, but good as a mid-range smartphone. I wrote below comparing it with other device in the same price range or as a middle class machine. I cannot evaluate this correctly if I compare it with device in the different price range or different class with current smartphone market.. I don't feel secure because of it thinness, but I am personally happy with it in terms of its texture and color. Because it is big, women and kids may have to get used to it in using, but this is good for this price.. It is thin but big, so some people may find it inconvenient. But some people have difficulty in typing in when their device is too small, so I think this is just right.. Buttons on sides are not slippery, and I like that they are poking out a little.. It responds well, and it has ATOK installed. I think the response of the main key is good, too.. It is very good thanks to Gorilla Glass and octa-core.. It has several more than ZenFone2. There are some area where it has been improved with Android 6.0.. Though it has a new one, it may not be able to handle something with high-load.. It doesn't have anything particularly good, but it is relatively good.. Some recent carrier smartphones have lower battery capacity, but this one has a right capacity battery. By changing the setting of Android or installing specialized apps, its battery life can be longer. I cannot promise that, though, as I haven't adjusted mine yet.. I bought it in the end of December 2016.. I bought this for the advantages I wrote above. This is an excellent device for those who use SIM free smartphones thinking design and balance. If you seek high performance or you are fussy, go for another smartphone. This price and memory are attractive, too.. Some people may find this disappointing expecting highly because of the make's advertisement. But there are some people who buy device early and look into them, so you should check those websites and decide which one suits you best.. Personally, if my budget allows, I would like to try other ZenFone 3 series.. It uses metal on the body and metal plates on home button and edges. It has more high-end feel than its actual price. As for the rear, the position of the camera, light and laser (infra red) emitting and receiving unit are different to other models. The lens is poking out, and that makes it less stable placed on desks and that. Just a cheap case can improve this.. I was worried as it is 5.5inch, but because it has narrow bezel and is thin, it seems not so different from ZenFone 5.. Just like other ZenFone series, return, home and task buttons are out of the screen. I personally like it as it allows me to use the screen. I want them to keep this with ZenFone series after this.. Going straight to the point, it is enough and necessary. Snapdragon 430 is said to be lower to middle range, but it seems it is as good as previous 600 series, which is middle to high range. I play Cinderella girls straight stage, and that gives the highest load for the phone for my usage. But even that, I can play with 3D. It should be satisfactory unless you are a heavy user.. Because I have Asus devices, I am used to it. Even putting it aside, this is an excellent UI.. FHD for 5.5inch, so it is not as good as high-end device, but it has high resolution and looks clearly. But with the default setting, the color looks rather whitish. Personally I don't mind it, but you can improve it by adjusting with the setting.. To me, ringtone and notification sound only have to he heard, so volume is the only point I should evaluate. But this speaker may not be good enough to enjoy music or movies. It would be better to use a headphone or external speakers when you listen to music or watch movies.. For my usage, it has 40-50% remaining after a day.. It has Soc which is powerful enough, 4GB RAM, 32GB ROM, FHD and finger print sensor. The images the camera takes are flat, but it is easy to use with high resolution. For those who don't need DSDS, it feels it has good cost performance especially after getting disappointed with ZenFone 3 costing 40,000yen.. It is a good model, but it fails in reading SIM. I bought this for my parent's birthday present.. It costs less than 30,000yen, but it has high-end feel. It has both lightness easy enough for my over 60 year-old parent to use and screen size big enough for his aged eyes. Fingerprint sensor is rectangle, but I don't feel uneasy about it much.. As for my parent's usage, using it heavily is only for watching movies. For this use, you can use it without feeling stressed. I don't know what it would be like with games, but this is good enough for this price.. It has many unnecessary apps, but the menu function itself is good.. I was amazed with this image quality which is as good as carrier smartphones! Incredible.. He use this with data SIM.. This is only as good as I expected, but my parent seems happy with it.. As for my parent's usage, it lasts for a few days except when he used a lot for taking pictures while on holiday. I think it sounds too big, but it has good enough performance that satisfies my parent, who likes taking photos. I bought this thinking using it with micro size data SIM, but it didn't read it first. I asked at customer service center, then they said they would replace it for initial failure. Because I bought it online, they said it would take more than two weeks to replace it. That wouldn't have made to my parent's birthday, so I decided to seek other way.. When I looked up, it seemed it would work if I make it Nano SIM, so I bought a SIM cutter. But using a SIM cutter made me nervous, and the fact that the users need to do this is a critical defect.. My parent is happy with it, so considering its performance and price, I can give it 5 stars, but the initial failure of SIM reading is a big minus. If you are thinking buying this, in case of initial failure, it is better to buy at a physical store.. I replaced ZenFone Go with this. I was not happy with ZenFone 5's camera image quality, so I replaced it.. It has good texture and shape.. ZenFone Go had a power button on top, but this one has one on the right side in the middle, so I accidentally press it often, and I end up turning it off.. It is not just this model, but I think smartphones of this manufacturer is rather difficult to input text.. It is beautiful with full HD. It is not as good compared to Galaxy and iPhone.. It lasts well as I only bought this recently, but even considering that, this has an excellent battery life. It should last at least a day even when I use it heavily.. I am very happy with this. I read many people reporting initial failure, so I had a difficulty in deciding, but I bought it daringly.. As a result, luckily, I didn't get the one with initial failure.. If I try to point out points I am not happy with this, it's the shape of the fingerprint sensor; it is long and thin vertically, so I cannot touch it well when I put a thick cover on it. Also, it would be great if the battery life was a little longer.. I am very happy except for those points.. Maganda ang phone ko na ito kasi magaling ito sa lalo na pag sa mga mobile games itong phone ko na ito matibay talaga lags wala ito at sa design lang naman din talaga ay napaka astig lang talaga ang ganda din ng camera nito kaya idol ko ang phone na ito hindi din naman mahirap gamitin kasi may mga phone kasing maraming function pero ito simple lang pero maraming gawa!.

For the first 5-6 months everything more less went smoothly. more I have noticed this slow buggy performance with the camera too :-/. Log manager keeps on running everyday.

For the first 5-6 months everything more less went smoothly. But after updating Android 6 to 7 (and other updates as well) I have a crap instead of phone now. I have the same problem with camera - slow and buggy and it often turns off saying ''no response''. Same issue with other programs and apps. And I am not even talking about Snapchat, maps and other 'more requiring' apps. This phone lags with most of the apps. I think you can find way more better phones with similar value.. jefri ajub, 23 Dec 2017 why mine charging was so long?? it takes 3 hours to made it 100%. is it really this long or it... more I think it's a normal..cause it also happen to me when the battery reach under 15%... jefri ajub, 23 Dec 2017 why mine charging was so long?? it takes 3 hours to made it 100%. is it really this long or it... Maybe it can enable with custom kernel.. Worst camera ever used on a Android cell phone, the zoom doesn't work. why mine charging was so long?? it takes 3 hours to made it 100%. is it really this long or it is an error?? someone who used this please answer me,,i'll be really appreciate it, thankss!!. Camera wise, it is good for daylight shooting. Video is the worst even with EIS stabilizer. You can only record without panning your camera. Panning will blur the whole recording process making it better not to record any video at the end.. I've been using this 4GB RAM version for 1 year. Everything smooth and able to play AOV or Mobile Legends at ease. Only thing laggy is when typing for Whatsapp or any chat app due to low CPU. Occasionally I got trouble with the keyboard suggestion which is broken as I use trace typing which I swipe over the keyboard instead of typing for faster response on messages.. how much the price if i buy in the philippines?. please help me to decide i will buy or go to other phone?. viol3tsparrow, 23 Nov 2017 I WANTED to love this phone.

I WANTED to love this phone. It's a beautiful handset with an attractive price point, but there were a few factors that led me to upgrade to my current Huawei P10. The first thing is that when upgraded to the most recent version of Android, this phone was unable to complete even the smallest of requests. Even something as simple as opening the browser resulted in several seconds of lag. The screen would freeze, and I often had to restart the phone just to get things running somewhat smoothly again. Although it produced nice pictures when it worked, it was so slow and buggy I dreaded using it. My main opinion on this phone is that the RAM and processor are simply not sophisticated enough to do even the tiniest of tasks. Asus makes some fantastic devices, but you'd be better off purchasing a Zenfone 3 or 4 than this.. Surfer99, 17 Nov 2017 Very, very slow sometimes. The camera takes too much time to start..... more Asus just release a new firmware update the other day. It seems good so far so try that.. The camera takes too much time to start...

Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The Asus ZenFone 3 Laser has been priced at Rs. It sports a metal body and packs a 3000mAh battery. Gadgets 360 rates the phone 7 out of 10. Asus has focused on the premium segment with its third-generation ZenFone smartphone range. The company has made it clear that it no longer wants to fight it out in the budget smartphone market where competition has been fierce lately. Asus is now looking to take on the likes of Apple , LG , and Samsung. While the Taiwanese company is yet to launch the top-end ZenFone 3 Deluxe that will go up against all of today's flagships, the rest of the range is steadily being released in India.. We reviewed the Asus ZenFone 3 (ZE552KL) a little while ago and it came out looking like a strong alternative for buyers who are looking at the popular OnePlus 3 ( Review ). Recently, the company started selling the Asus ZenFone 3 Laser (ZC551KL) in India, which will only be available online for a month before hitting offline retail channels.. Similar to other ZenFone 3 models, the new Asus ZenFone 3 Laser runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow and features a metal body. This particular model is aimed at shutterbugs, with its quick autofocus and improved camera. Will that be enough to set it apart from the competition? We try to find out.. Asus ZenFone 3 Laser look and feel The ZenFone 3 Laser sports an all-metal body with 2.5D Corning Gorilla Glass in front for protection. It measures 149x76x7.9mm and weighs 150 grams. Despite featuring a 5.5-inch screen , the ZenFone 3 Laser easily fits in one hand. The Asus ZenFone 3 (ZE552KL) , on the other hand, has the same screen size but we didn't find it as comfortable to use one-handed.. The front is dominated by the 5.5-inch full-HD display, above which is the front camera. According to Asus, the handset sports 77 percent screen-to-body ratio. There are capacitive Android navigation buttons below the display. Considering that the navigation buttons are not backlit, we initially found this phone hard to use in the dark. Our review unit was the Sand Gold colour, and this phone will be also available in silver.. The rear is also metal, unlike the ZenFone 3 which came with glass back. There are two lines running across top and bottom of the rear, similar to the back of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3. Asus says that this phone has a fingerprint- and smudge-resistant oleophobic coating.. The rear camera protrudes from the back and follows the same design language as the rest of the ZenFone 3 range. Near it, you'll see the dual-LED flash and laser autofocus emitter. The fingerprint scanner is placed right below the camera, and Asus branding can be seen at the bottom. The power and volume buttons are on the right, while the hybrid SIM slot is on the left. The top features the 3.5mm audio jack while the bottom has a standard Micro-USB port and speaker grille.. One of the difficulties we faced during the review period was that the edges of the Micro-USB port and the two screws on the bottom were a bit sharp, and and we ended up with minor scratches on our palm while using this phone.. The 5.5-inch full-HD (1080x1920-pixel) IPS display is vibrant and can reproduce colours really well. Blacks are rich, and the brightness level is also quite good. Users can adjust the colour temperature using Asus' Splendid app. Sunlight legibility was decent and we had no trouble using the handset outdoors at any given time. Viewing angle was also not a problem while watching movie, video, or any other multimedia content.. We however found that the display was fingerprint magnet and we had to clean it from time to time. Much like the ZenFone 3 (ZE552KL), the ZenFone 3 Laser features a blue light filter that claims to protect eyes from glare. During our review, we didn't face any issue with touch response, and there's support for using this phone with gloves as well.. Asus ZenFone 3 Laser specifications and software The ZenFone 3 Laser is powered by an octa-core 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 processor clocked at 1.4GHz, with integrated Adreno 505 graphics and 4GB of LPDDR3 RAM. It packs 32GB of built-in storage and supports up to 128GB more using a microSD card. In collaboration with Google, Asus is also offering up to 100GB of cloud storage on Google Drive for two years, which you can use to store photos, videos, and other documents.. There's a 13-megapixel rear camera with f/2.0 aperture and dual-LED real-tone flash. It supports 1080p video recording at 30 fps. There's also an 8-megapixel front camera with f/2.0 aperture. Connectivity options include Bluetooth 4.2, Wi-Fi 802.11a/b/g/n, Wi-Fi direct, GPS/A-GPS, Glonass, and 4G. The handset has a hybrid SIM slot and supports one Micro-SIM and the other slot is for a Nano-SIM, but users have to choose between two SIMs or one SIM with one microSD card.. Asus claims that SIM in either slot can support 3G and 4G networks though only one can be active at a time. The ZenFone 3 Laser supports LTE cat 4 speeds, which means downloads of up to 150 Mbps and uploads of up to 50 Mbps. The handset is backed by a 3000mAh non-removable battery.. The Asus ZenFone 3 Laser runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow with the company's ZenUI 3.0 skin on top. The software running on the ZenFone 3 Laser is identical to that of the ZenFone 3 (ZE552KL) and you can read more about it in our review of the ZenFone 3. The most notable features include the real-time animated weather and clock widgets; parallax motion effect on the home screen; and Zen motion gestures that let you perform tasks quickly.. Asus over the years has definitely improved its ZenUI interface. The latest version seems light, clean, and uncluttered. We were however disappointed to see a lot of Asus's own apps including Themes, Photo Collage, Mini Movie, ZenCircle, ZenSync, Weather, Do It Later, Game Genie, ZenFone Care, and Cover. There are also some third-party apps including Amazon Shopping, Saavn, TripAdvisor, Instagram, Amazon Kindle, and Facebook. Many of these could have been done away with.. Asus ZenFone 3 Laser camera The camera app on the ZenFone 3 Laser launched quickly even from the lock screen. The interface is easy to understand. Users can choose Manual, HDR Pro, Beautification, Super Resolution, Low-light, QR Code, Night, Depth of field, Effect, Selfie, GIF animation, Panorama, Miniature, Time rewind, Slow motion, or Time Lapse. It's worth noting that all these modes are consistent across the ZenFone 3 range.. One of the most hyped features of this phone is its laser autofocus technology which claims to locks focus in just 0.03 seconds. During our review, we found that this feature really did work pretty fast. The laser autofocus plays a major role when taking close-up shots.. The camera on the ZenFone 3 Laser can take some amazing photos with a good amount of detail and decent colour reproduction in well-lit conditions. On zooming in to images, we detected slight noise and grain in the corners. We were especially impressed with low-light shots taken by the ZenFone 3 Laser, which are good even though there was some grain and oversaturation at times.. Tap to see full-sized Asus ZenFone 3 Laser camera samples. We tried recording 1080p videos on the ZenFone 3 Laser and the results were great. The electronic image stabilisation (EIS) feature came in handy while recording videos, making them clean even when our hands weren't steady.. The front camera is also decent and takes selfies quickly. On opening the front-facing camera, the ZenFone 3 Laser automatically launches Beautification mode, though users can disable it. In our opinion, this phone is decent for everyday pictures.. Asus ZenFone 3 Laser performance The Asus ZenFone 3 Laser manages does a good job of multitasking, but did slow down a bit with lots of apps open in the background. Watching movies is pleasant thanks to the display quality. We didn't face any heating issues except for it getting slightly warm when charging, gaming, and recording videos at 1080p. Similar to other metal-bodied devices, the ZenFone 3 Laser can get slippery, especially with sweaty hands. During our review, the ZenFone 3 Laser slipped out of our hands a couple of times, but thankfully no damage was done to the unit.. The fingerprint scanner responded well during our usage and was quick at times. The phone can unlocked with a fingerprint even when it's in standby, which is convenient. The omission of a USB Type-C port is one thing that seems dated about this phone. The speakers are loud enough, and the bundled earphones are decent for music quality with minimal distortion at higher volumes.. The Asus ZenFone 3 Laser turned in passable scores when we ran usual suite of benchmark tests, with 43,140 and 23,956 in AnTuTu and Quadrant respectively. GFXBench and 3D Mark Ice Storm Extreme returned 15fps and 5,570 points respectively.. Featuring a non-removable 3000mAh battery, the ZenFone 3 Laser was able to run for 12 hours and 25 minutes in our video loop test. This was really surprising, considering that the ZenFone 3 ran for 13 hours and 45 minutes in the same test. With a few hours of calling, Internet browsing, photography, watching videos on YouTube, and using standard apps including Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp plus everyday tasks, the ZenFone 3 Laser was able to last over a day. The ZenFone 3 Laser, unlike other ZenFone 3 smartphones, doesn't support fast charging.. Verdict Asus has gambled a little by pricing the ZenFone 3 Laser at around Rs. Xiaomi's Redmi 3S and Redmi 3S Prime ( Review ) are powered by the same octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 SoC, and are priced below Rs. Performance in benchmarks is below that of other phones we have seen at the ZenFone 3 Laser's price level.. Recommending this phone therefore becomes tough. Competitors such as the Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime ( Review ) and Lenovo Z2 Plus ( Review ) offer better value for money in terms of overall performance. The ZenFone 3 Laser's camera does stand out, but it cannot justify such a high price premium. Considering that this phone also has a metal body, decent screen, and software enhancements, a price of Rs. 15,000 or less would be much more appropriate.. For those interested, the Asus ZenFone 3 Laser (ZC551KL) is now selling on Flipkart , where it will be exclusive for a month before becoming more widely available.. Asus ZenFone 3 Laser in pictures.

The latest in the Zenfone family, Asus Zenfone 3 laser offers a sleek unibody metal design. The smartphone is easy to use with one hand and offers decent daylight camera photography. Though, the images captured in low light are a little grainier. The smartphone offers a good performance and multitasking is also fun. However, if youâre looking for a device that could offer you both performance and battery life, than you can look for other smartphones such as Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 and Lenovo Vibe K5 Note.

But despite the decent attempt at going with tried and tested way, there is no way that I would suggest this smartphone to anyone for the Rs 18,999.

Asus Zenfone 3 Laser Review: Itâs All About the Camera! Source: Tech PP The Laser series by the Taiwanese company has over the time spoilt us by offering good quality cameras at a comparatively lower price. The price is higher this time around, but while the device has scored well on the camera and the battery front, we feel it couldnât really step it up in terms of performance â blame it on the processor perhaps. The Asus Zenfone 3 Laser scores a few brownie points but will find the going tough against the likes of the Lenovo Z2 Plus and Le Eco Le Max 2 which offer the top notch Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor at a similar price. We think the Laser definitely has its task âcutâ out when it comes to giving other phones in its price segment some stiff competition. Single Review, online available, Long, Date: 12/08/2016. ASUS ZenFone 3 Laser Review Source: Mobygyaan A premium looking phone from such a recognized brand can be better off competing for the spec-oriented devices. Not saying that the ZenFone 3 Laser is underpowered by its specs, people do expect other things rather than just specs. A good camera, a great design along with a better display and better battery backup, a phone that fits well in the hands may not be found in the phones that boast its hardware. Single Review, online available, Very Long, Date: 11/29/2016. ASUS ZenFone 3 Laser Hands On [Images] Source: Mobygyaan ASUS ZenFone 3 Laser is the larger variant in ZenFone 3 series sized at 5.5-inch featuring laser autofocus and a metallic design along with 2.5D curved glass. ZenFone 3 series is now focusing on the premium segment rather picking up the highly competitive budget price bracket that is already dominated by the brands like Xiaomi, Lenovo, and LeEco. ASUS ZenFone 3 Laser is priced at â¹18,999. We have shared our hands-on review below.

The problem for Asus Zenfone 3 Laser isnât competition from other phones, it is from the brand itself. The Zenfone 3 Max has a lot more battery on offer, and comes in a cheaper variant as well. Plus, there are phones with better processors like Lenovo Z2 Plus with Snapdragon 820 available at Rs 17,999 in the market. With the Snapdragon 430, Zenfone 3 Laser seems overpriced at Rs 18,999.

But looking at the specs offered by the device, it definitely feels underpowered at this price segment. Redmi 3S Prime sporting the same processor is priced 8999. So it is definitely hard to recommend the Zenfone 3 Laser at this pricing, probably the best pricing for this devicee would have been sub 15k. The only saving grace for this device is the camera, but then for this pricing the device is not the best value for money.

Asus Zenfone 3 Laser Review: The True Mid-Range Zenfone 3? Source: Unbox At the end of the day, the ZF3 Laser is a great mid-range phone thatâs not out of reach for most working class Juans out there. Itâs a solid performer, and can handle most, if not all, Android apps you throw at it. It has an impressive camera as well, and as long as you do your part, itâs capable of producing really good photos in a pinch. At Php 11,995, itâs slight more expensive than the ZF3 Max, but the extra cash you spend for it is worth it. Single Review, online available, Very Long, Date: 11/08/2016. Asus Zenfone 3 Laser Review Source: Gadget Diary The handset can easily last one full day of use with light to medium use which I feel is decent enough for a 3,000mAh battery. If you are looking to buy a phone with great camera and a decent battery life then look no more, It has everything one looks for a daily use mobile. It looks great, has an impressive screen and a beautiful UI. I just wish Asus would have used a better processor, but even now it is one of the best camera phones you can buy under 20,000INR.

However, these phones are also miles ahead in performance. In my opinion, what those phones lack in the camera department, they more than make up for in others, and thatâs why I wouldnât recommend the Zenfone 3 Laser over them.

Zenfone 3 Laser ZC551KL Unboxing, Initial Review: The Zenfone Youâll Buy This Christmas? Source: Unbox The biggest problem for the ZF3 Laser we feel is price. If ASUS launched this particular phone earlier, at least along with the ZF3 Max, it could have had a good head-start against all the other Snapdragon 430-equipped phones coming out this holiday season.

In the notebook sector, Asus had a global market share of about 11% from 2014-2016, making it the fourth largest laptop manufacturer.

Zenfone Ares – Pre Order Zenfone 5z – Zenfone 5 Review, Where To Buy, News. We are 100% Asus Zenfone content! Pre order Zenfone Ares, Zenfone 5z and Zenfone 5 reviews. News on all models including: Pro, Max and more!. Asus Zenfone 3 Laser (ZC551KL) Review. 5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) display. 32GB Storage (expandable to another 128GB via microSD card slot). 149 x 76 x 7.9mm (WxDxH). Android 6.0 (upgradeable to Android 7.0 Nougat). 13MP rear / 8MP front cameras. The Zenfone 3 line-up is diverse and covers the gamut of price ranges. At the top there is the Zenfone 3 Deluxe and at the opposite end is the Zenfone 3 Max, rounded out with a number of models that fall in between those price ranges. The Zenfone 3 Laser is a step above the Zenfone 3 Max so think of it as the second cheapest Zenfone 3 model available.. Paying top dollar for a phone and having the latest processor with top benchmark results is not a priority for everyone out there. This is the target market for the Zenfone 3 Laser. It’s obvious to say, but there is some give and take when it comes to budget smartphones.. I looked at the cheaper Zenfone 3 Max initially but paying around $50 more for the Zenfone 3 Laser made more sense. After all, the Zenfone 3 Laser is packing a FHD 1920 x 1080p display which is a big selling point for me.. I didn’t just get the Zenfone 3 Laser (ZC551KL) for the sake of a review. This was a $249 CAD purchase I made out of necessity. I wanted to get a second smartphone which meant price was more important than having the latest and greatest hardware. As an overall value I thought this was a great deal for an unlocked Android smartphone.. I’ve been using the Zenfone 3 Laser over the past couple of weeks and here are my thoughts and experiences.. Note: see Asus.com for full details. Asus has a knack for creating beautiful hardware. Even with its cheaper price point, the Zenfone 3 Laser (ZC551KL) is not a bulky or ugly looking. It’s very attractive with subtle design features. There are chrome accents and comfortable to hold rounded edges. It comes in either silver or gold color and the model I’m reviewing is the silver version.. Speaking of the edges and comfortable design, Asus makes use of “hyperfine” sand blasting to polish the metal surface of the phone. I can attest to the benefits. It’s a nice phone to hold. A metallic body provides a premium feel which almost seems counter intuitive to suggest.. Although the Zenfone 3 Laser is a 5.5-inch device, it feels very light in the hand. Keep in mind that the iPhone 6 Plus weighs in at 172g (6.07 oz) in comparison to the Zenfone 3 Laser’s 150g (5.29 oz). The iPhone 7 Plus weighs even more than the iPhone 6 Plus! In fact the Zenfone 3 Laser is lighter than the newest Galaxy S8 and last year’s Galaxy S7 models. Of course the lower specs of the Zenfone 3 Laser are part of this weight advantage but still it’s an interesting tidbit.. On the rear is a finger print sensor which is snappy to unlock the phone. Location wise I’m not a fan of the rear placement simply because I often have my phone sitting on a table. If it’s charging for example, it’s going to be laying flat. A rear facing finger print sensor means I have to pick up the device to access the finger print sensor. At that point the path of least resistance is to simply use your alternate unlock method.. The Zenfone 3 Laser is budget friendly so rather than having a USB-C port, it comes with a standard micro-USB charging port. If this means saving a few dollars it’s well worth the compromise. I’m sure most of us know how to orientate the micro-USB cable when connecting the phone so the real benefits of the USB-C are just limited to faster data transfers.. A big design breakthrough for Asus in their Zenfone 3 line-up was having invisible antenna lines. I bet some of you don’t know what that really means. The antenna lines run horizontally across the back of mobile phones. This has been a necessary design from mobile phone manufacturers over the years. However with budget in mind, the Zenfone 3 Laser comes with the antenna lines on the rear of the phone. In my opinion these do not create an eye sore. These lines have a chrome look and feel and could be thought of as part of the phones design.. The volume rocker and power button are nice and punchy. They have good response and the engraved concentric circles make them less slippery or more tactile. When it comes to subtle design features Asus rarely misses the mark.. The Zenfone 3 Laser also features a microSD card slot for up to 128GB additional storage. If you want to store movies, videos and music, this additional storage can save a bit of hassle. The 32GB of local storage is great for this price, but if you’re keeping your videos on local storage along with apps and games, it can fill up rather quickly. Even with the 32GB listed storage, it’s less than that out of the box because of the pre installed apps and software.. Lower resolution displays mean better battery life and a cheaper device price. However the Zenfone 3 Laser brings the cheap price without sacrificing on the display. The Zenfone 3 Laser provides 500nits brightness from its 1920 x 1080 FHD display. To me the FHD is worth the price of admission. You can enjoy those 1080p videos and movies which should be enticing for most users these days. More and more we live in an HD world.. Maximum brightness is measured in nits and is something to think about. At 500nits, the Zenfone 3 Laser is lower than the 600nits of the Zenfone 3 (ZE552KL) model. In a side by side comparison there would only be a slight difference between the two. If you are hoping for an ideal mobile phone for use with bright sunlight, the Zenfone 3 Laser is going to do a decent job but it’s pretty much like most other similarly priced phone on the market. The Zenfone 3 Laser provides good audio from a single mono speaker. Asus markets this speaker as being “5-magnet for up to 40% better performance”. What that means in real terms, I can’t say. In reality though, the phone can handle volume at its maximum without resulting in crackling or distortion. If you have an external speaker or headset the results are excellent and volumes are punchy.. If you are in a pinch and need even more volume or clarity you can also set the audio to “outdoor mode”. Keep in mind with outdoor mode that you get a volume boost but it will not always provide a better or more clear audio experience. A small issue is that it’s easy to accidentally activate outdoor mode so I often needed to check my audio settings to ensure that it was disabled.. Asus has their “Audio Wizard” app which gives you some audio presets and EQ settings. This app has far more use when you are using some type of external audio hardware because the EQ and presets are far more noticeable.. There is always lots to talk about when it comes to a mobile phone battery. I’m going to break this down into various sections to make it easier. Also please appreciate the wide range of variables which can alter results such as background apps, signal strength, room temperatures, case on or off, among other factors.. I ran a variety of video playback tests and used to brightness settings. This should provide you with a good idea on how long you can play videos for without needing to worry about charging the phone.. I enabled airplane mode and ensured that all other apps were closed while running these tests.. When playing a 1080p movie from local storage, at 100% brightness the battery would drain by approximately 20%. In theory, that would allow you to play around four 2-hour 1080p movies before needing a charge.. When playing this same movie under the same conditions with 50% brightness, the battery would drain by approximately 16%. Theoretically that means you could play somewhere around six movies on a single charge provided you dim the brightness to 50% or less.. Streaming video via wifi is generally a bit different and more taxing on a battery but the test results didn’t support this theory. I used an online streaming service similar to Netflix for these tests. So wifi was turned on but all other apps were closed during these tests.. When streaming the video at 100% brightness, the battery drained by around 22%. When streaming the video at 50% brightness, the battery drained by around 16%. So the streaming aspect of this test wasn’t particularly more draining to the battery than when running a movie off of the local storage.. I ran a variety of gaming tests under a few different settings. Largely I went either 100% brightness or 50% brightness using the “Normal” performance mode. If you are playing a graphically intensive game it may be best to use the “Performance” mode. For what I was doing the normal mode was sufficient. If you go performance mode obviously the phone will push hard, get warmer and use more battery.. Playing a variety of game, you can expect to drain about 8-10% of the battery in 30 minutes of gaming while using full 100% brightness. If you play under the same conditions but lower the brightness to 50%, you can expect the battery to drain about 6-8%. Even at 50% brightness you could lower it even more and still see the screen clearly depending on the lighting conditions.. Overall the Zenfone 3 Laser warmed up during gaming sessions but it wasn’t hot. If you put a chunky case then certainly expect a warmer phone and greater battery drainage. I was quite happy with the battery life while gaming. Keep in mind that if you’re using mobile data or have multiple games running in the background then your battery usage is going to be greater. There are lots of variables to deal with but hopefully my testing gives you a good perspective on what to expect.. When you phone sits idle, you hope the battery is around the same level when you pick it up. I ran a variety of standby tests over a couple of weeks. Standby battery drain is a tricky measurement. Any apps in the background can cause issues as can a weak wifi or network connection. I’ve done my best here to recreate common scenarios.. With the Android 7.0 Nougat update, I found the Doze feature to make a big difference. If your phone is entirely motionless the doze feature will just work. So this works well during overnight situations. If your phone is in your pocket and you’re out and about, the doze function will not activate.. Asus has a handy performance app which gives you some options to save battery life. For example, you can set a time frame with a power saving setting such as super saver mode. So if you sleep from 11pm to 7am you can simply choose that time along with your preferred power saving mode.. If you close out your apps, use “Normal” performance mode with wifi ON, you will see 3-4% battery loss. If you enable airplane mode then you are going to see even less battery loss during standby. Some apps work in the background when wifi is enabled so the best option is to enable airplane mode if you really want to see minimal standby battery loss.. There is no fancy Quick Charge technology inside the Zenfone 3 Laser. As I’ve experience on other devices, the Quick Charge technology is only partially useful anyways.. To fully charge the Zenfone 3 Laser from a dead battery state, you’re looking at just over 3 hours. I’m sure most users don’t drain their battery though. You can charge 30% of the battery in under an hour. If you’re charging with the battery around 50%, it’s going to take less than 1.5 hours to fully charge the battery.. Overall these charge times are respectable even though there is no Quick Charge technology on the Zenfone 3 Laser.. It’s interesting that the branding of this phone includes “laser” which refers to a super quick laser auto focus. Keep in mind that this technology is employed on the other more premium priced Zenfone 3 models. Asus has made a big push on photography in every model with the exception of the Zenfone 3 Max but let’s see if the cheaper Zenfone 3 Laser can get the job done.. Video wise the Zenfone 3 Laser is capable of shooting full HD 1080p @ 30FPS video with 3-axis EIS (electronic image stabilization). The front camera is 8MP with a f/2.0 aperture and the rear camera is 13MP with a f/2.0 aperture, 5 P lens. With the “laser” branding, this means a focus time of 0.03 seconds according to Asus marketing materials. I can verify that it’s very fast.. The Asus camera app offers quite a lot of flexibility for either auto settings photographers or for the more courageous manual settings photographers. The number of presets for the auto mode are varied and can help you in certain settings or help you create a particular effect. As I’ve mentioned in other Zenfone reviews, I quite fond of the “Depth of Field” preset which blurs out the background to create a lens blur effect similar to what’s found on expensive dSLR cameras. A good number of the presets will be enjoyable for the younger users in your family as you can create some wild, wacky and funny effects as well.. I am in the process of assembling various photos and video samples taken with the Zenfone 3 Laser. These will be added in the next day or two. Overall though, I found the cameras to be a solid performer and the video recording was particularly excellent.. Photography wise, I’m a complete amateur who relies on auto modes and presets. I can say on that basis that I found the Zenfone 3 Laser camera to perform admirably in brighter outdoor environments. To be expect though, the camera would prove challenging in those less than ideal environments, namely low light. Certainly this is not an exclusive issue to the Zenfone 3 Laser as most cameras have their struggles with poorly lighted environments.. The photo below gives you an idea of how excellent the auto mode photography can be with the Zenfone 3 Laser. This is one of my favorite photos.. Bright outdoor conditions allow the Zenfone 3 Laser camera to work its wonders. It has an ability to catch details.. Most times the HDR mode resulted in excellent and more accurate outdoor photos. Contrast just seems better and details are more pronounced without getting washed out by too much brightness or contrast. See the sky and contrast in the photo below.. Depth of Field is my favorite Asus camera app preset. Here is an example of what’s possible:. 8MP selfie camera does a good job at focusing in on faces and even offers a “beautification” mode which some of us may want or need more than others. As with the rear camera, the front facing camera will struggle with focus and proper lighting as the environment is dimmer. Indoor selfies can prove challenging with less light.. If you have done any research online about the Zenfone 3 models, often you will hear negativity around the ZenUI software and the lack of Android updates. This negativity is largely unfounded based on my experience but let me explain.. First, Asus has rolled out Android 7.0 Nougat for most of the Zenfone 3 models already. In addition, there have been frequent software updates rolled out which improve various performance aspects of the phones over the year since their release. So to me, Asus is not forgetting about or abandoning the Zenfone 3 series at all when it comes to software updates. When I first powered up the Zenfone 3 Laser I was greeted with a software notification which was the Android 7.0 Nougat update.. Regarding ZenUI (the Asus layer running on top of the Android OS) I have not run into issues. Bloatware is a common and often misused term. For the sake of experimentation, I took the default apps and settings out of the box and diabled and removed every Asus related app on the Zenfone 3 Laser. So the OS at that point was unobstructed and only consisted of the default Google apps that are pre installed on the phone. The Asus keyboard was necessary to leave installed because otherwise there is no way of typing.. So the point of that experiment was to prove that removing or disabling pre installed apps is possible and takes only a matter of minutes. I’m not suggesting that it’s essential to disable or remove the Asus apps, but I am saying you have ultimate say in what apps are used. You could in theory install the Google apps to run the dialer, messaging, clock, keyboard, etc. There isn’t a lockdown on the Zenfone 3 Laser operating system.. With that out of the way let’s talk about what’s good and what’s bad about ZenUI. The level of customization is excellent and with the ZenUI online store it makes it easy to check out other customizations. Some themes are free, others cost money. You can choose icon sets, themes and wallpapers. You can mix and match an icon set with a different theme as well. When using the online store you can preview themes and icon sets to see what it looks like prior to downloading which saves some time and hassle.. Asus also has a settings menu which is accessible with a swipe up when you’re on the home screen. This gives you access to various customizations but also it gets you a way into system settings. This is a seemingly minor feature but with the phones size, it is one way you can get into system settings when you are using one hand. Of course you could move a shortcut to system settings to make it accessible on the home screen but I personally find home screen real estate to be at a premium.. The Asus ZenUI keyboard is good and bad. It’s very good with its level of customization. You can truly make this a bigger size and you can also reposition it so that it’s easier with one handed usage. Keep in mind that size adjustments need to be made separately for portrait and landscape modes.. The bad is in the keyboard AI. If you are not a skilled touch typist and often add a letter where it shouldn’t be, the Asus keyboard is not that smart in offering the corrected word as a suggestion. Those times when you have two words stuck together, the keyboard AI often fails to identify that it’s two words stuck together and offer them with a space as a suggestion. Over time this can be frustrating if you are sloppy at touch typing like I am.. ZenUI offers a lot of paths to the same destination which can add some unnecessary bulk to the software. There are perhaps too many settings in too many areas. Some settings require drilling down through menus which can lead to some confusion if you don’t have a good memory.. There is a lot of flexibility and customization within ZenUI which can be a good thing and a bad thing at the same time. Themes, icon sets, wallpapers, Asus has you covered and they have convenient online stores where you can shop for new looks. Both free and paid options are available. There is a very good system in the online store that allows you to swipe the various screens of each theme and icon set so you can see what the changes will look like prior to downloading. The hardware inside the Zenfone 3 Laser has been chosen with budget in mind. Inside are 2GB RAM along with a Snapdragon 430 @ 1.4GHz with an Adreno 505 GPU. As a point of reference, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus comes with 1GB RAM and 1.4GHz processor. Apple has a pretty optimized operating system to work with their hardware but this comparison should illustrate the fact that the Zenfone 3 Laser isn’t exactly a slouch when it comes to hardware.. When doing benchmarks for the Zenfone 3 Laser I’ve decided to choose wisely on comparison devices. It’s certainly not relevant to compare the Zenfone 3 Laser to the current flagship phones. So price is an important factor and also I thought it would be fun to add some flagship phones from last year. Today’s phones with slower processors and hardware would be considered flagship phones sometimes as recent as twelve months ago.. You can see from the various benchmarks that the Zenfone 3 Laser basically falls in the middle of the pack. This is ultimately as it should be. The Zenfone 3 Laser cannot bring a low price yet be near the top of benchmark results. In real terms it’s certainly fast enough for the apps and media that you will be consuming on the phone. Bars in a chart don’t speak to how a device is in real terms. All the phone compared in the benchmarks above are all fully capable in their own right.. First and foremost the Zenfone 3 Laser (ZC551KL) is an affordable unlocked Android smartphone. It’s even more affordable because these days you’re going to find price drops of around $30 to $40. In Canada it’s as low as $249 and in the US it’s a low as $197. You will see this pricing trend continue into mid 2017.. I think of the Zenfone 3 Laser as an all around performer. It doesn’t have top end hardware and it doesn’t have that big battery that the budget Zenfone 3 Max series has. There are no glaring shortcomings and there are no eye bulging features or qualities. It’s right there in the middle as it was meant to be.. What you do get though is an excellent FHD 1980 x 1080 resolution display along with a brilliantly light and thin build quality. The Zenfone 3 Laser offers premium looks and that counts for something. It’s budget in price but not in looks.. In terms of hardware there is enough processing power and RAM to get the job done. The Zenfone 3 Laser will not struggle to play your 1080p videos or stream content online. It can also manage mobile games without issue. However if you push the hardware like leaving many apps open in the background, the performance can suffer. Simply close out the open apps running in the background and the performance and battery life will thank you.. I don’t generally let customer reviews guide my views on a product but I found the various big retailer customer reviews to be quite telling. As a whole the reviews from customers are extremely positive. It validates my own experience with the Zenfone 3 Laser.. The price is right with the Zenfone 3 Laser and I need to emphasize that point. It’s ideal for anyone who wants to get into smartphones and isn’t going to be needing premium hardware performance. The freedom of having an unlocked phone means you can use it on any carrier of your choice which can also save you money. The Zenfone 3 Laser means you can enjoy Android and everything it brings without having to over spend.. Shop Now For A Zenfone 4:. Shop now for a Zenfone 4 – International Shipping – eBay.

Where the Zenfone 3 is the flagship device for Asus, the company has a history of introducing accompanying devices that bring most of the design language and popular features to lower price points. We saw this with the Zenfone 2 Laser and it sure seems like the company wants to make this a tradition with the launch of the Zenfone 3 Laser. With a shift in the pricing structure though the Zenfone 3 Laser sits right in line with the likes of the Xiaomi Mi5 and others. Does it have what it takes to compete? We find out in our review.. Asus Zenfone 3 Laser (ZC551KL) specifications. Where the Zenfone 3 that we reviewed earlier on adopted a mix of glass and metal, the Zenfone 3 Laser goes a little simpler with design. Replacing the somewhat glamorous design language of the flagship is a more subdued brushed metal finish.. Up front is a 5.5 inch display with fairly minimal bezels on either side. Meanwhile above the screen you’ll find the standard array of sensors as well as the 8MP front facing camera. Typical of Asus phones, there’s a row of capacitive buttons below the display in lieu of on-screen controls. While the buttons aren’t backlit, we found them to be sufficiently responsive. The glass above the display bends over gently around the corners in a finish akin to a subtle 2.5D curve. A metallic bezel runs around the edge of the screen but this time around, it is not along the sides of the phone. Instead, the bezel is placed on the face of the device so you don’t really feel it when holding the phone but it does manage to protect the corners of the screen to a degree.. On the right hand side you’ll find the volume rocker as well as the power button. The tactile feedback is decent here albeit a bit more mushy than we’d have preferred. The headphone jack is conveniently located. at the top of the phone while a microUSB charging port is placed at the bottom. The fingerprint reader is on the rear of the handset and is placed fairly ergonomically. The reader itself while not the fastest around, does the job just fine. It is also always on and so works even when in standby mode.. The back of the phone sports the fingerprint reader as we’d mentioned earlier. There’s a camera module that sticks out from the body of the phone making it relatively prone to scratches. On either side of the camera module is the Dual LED flash and the Laser Autofocus unit. It won’t be wrong to say that the phone is somewhat humdrum to look at. The metal back is a welcome addition and the antenna lines are well concealed but the design is decidedly generic. The Zenfone 3 Laser could pass off as any other Zenfone by Asus or for that matter most other phones in its category. We wish Asus had spiced up the design element here by bring some parts. of it’s gorgeous glass and metal finish from the Zenfone 3.. Typical Asus, there’s a whole lot of pre-installed applications on the Zenfone 3 Laser. Most users will find at least a few of these useful but there’s no doubt that there’s a monumental amount of bloat on the Zenfone series of phones. Like the Zenfone 3, there’s close to 26 apps pre-installed on the device. Yes, it is possible to remove a few of them but it doesn’t take away from the fact that there’s just too much bloat onboard. Asus maintains that users prefer to have all utilities available to them but we’re not entirely sure of that opinion ourselves.. The interface paradigm here is exactly the same as we’ve seen on multiple generations of Zenfones. The lockscreen includes a clock as well as three customisable shortcuts.. As expected, notifications show up here. Swiping up reveals the homescreen where you can place widgets and apps shortcuts. Unlike several other Chinese brands, Asus has retained the app drawer in their launcher.. Both the homescreen and app launcher are extremely customisable and include options for icon packs, themes and more. We also really like the smart group functionality built into the app drawer that allows you to automatically bundle apps into relevant folders.. Some other notable additions include the AudioWizard app that does a decent job at optimising playback depending on the usage scenario. From music to movies and games, the app. automatically apply equaliser settings to tweak how the content sounds. For the most part, it does quite well. The game genie app is another such addition that will appeal to streamers. The phone lets you stream your gameplay straight to YouTube or Twitch which is quite cool to be honest. Overall, the software on the Zenfone 3 Laser is pretty well optimized but there’s just way too many pre-installed applications onboard that should. The Zenfone 3 Laser has an Octa-Core Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 under the hood. This processor has 4 Cortex A53 cores clocked at 1.2Ghz alongside 4 Cortex A53 cores clocked at 1.5Ghz to facilitate a good balance between performance and battery. This is in addition to the Adreno 505 GPU. There’s 3GB of RAM onboard to facilitate decent multitasking. As an entry-level phone, the phone performs well enough. Menu transitions and general performance is as smooth as you’d expect from a phone powered by such entry-level internals. Push it too hard and things start slowing down a bit. The phone also heats up a bit while playing graphically intensive games. We’ve included a few benchmarks below to give you a better idea of comparative performance.. In the Vellamo browser benchmark, the phone scores 2422 points placing it towards the bottom of our test bench.. The phone scored 855 points in the Basemark OS II benchmark.. In Geekbench 3, the Zenfone 3 Laser scores 1988 points.. The 5.5 inch Full HD display on the Zenfone 3 Laser punches above its weight. A Gorilla Glass 3 coating on top protects it from scratches. We found the display to perform quite well when placed against similar devices. The color rendition is quite natural though there is a certain degree of color shift once you start looking at it from the sides.. Brightness levels on the display are a bit disappointing and could prove to be a problem when outdoors. The screen seems to be a bit of a step down from the Zenfone 3 despite having similar specs.. For a phone that’s USP is the camera or well, the fast laser based focussing capabilities, the Zenfone 3 Laser doesn’t perform all that well. In terms of specifications, the camera module has a 13MP IMX214 sensor manufactured by Sony. The lens has an f/2.0 aperture which ensures that sufficient light hits the sensor. Image quality though is pretty lacklustre.. The camera software particularly in manual mode offers a number of options that help in tweaking the image to your liking but generally images were rather noisy. There’s a huge range of options here including Depth of Field, Night, Low-Light, Super Resolution, Beautification, HDR Pro and many more that you can play around with to try and get the perfect shot.. As you’ll notice, the camera quality is below average. The phone also has a tough time hinting for focus which is a problem that it really shouldn’t be facing due to the laser focussing module built-in. The phone does have electronic image stabilisation but in our testing, we did not observe much. The Zenfone 3 has the usual range of connectivity options and there’s not much to set it aside. Unlike Xiaomi’s offerings, the phone does not have an infrared port so you won’t be able to use the phone for controlling appliances. You do get 4G LTE support as well as WiFi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1 and GPS. There’s 32GB of storage and you can expand that via a microSD card. Once again, the phone sports a Hybrid SIM slot which is something we really dislike but is quickly becoming the norm. Essentially, you’ll have to choose between dual SIM capabilities or storage expansion.. With a 3,000 mAh battery and a frugal Snapdragon 430 processor onboard, battery life is predictably quite decent. While there is no fast charging support, the phone easily lasts a day of use and more.. With regular use involving a couple of email accounts, social networks, WhatsApp and more, the phone still had about 30-35% battery left at the end of the day which is what we’d expect from a device of its class.. 19,999, it is really hard to make a case for the Zenfone 3 Laser. Sure, the phone isn’t all too bad but similar phones can be had for well less than half the price that Asus is commanding.. We liked the understated design, ergonomics and the pretty decent screen but were disappointed by the camera module and software set. If you’re looking at the Zenfone 3 Laser, we feel you might be better served by something like the Lenovo Z2 Plus or even the Xiaomi Redmi 3S..
