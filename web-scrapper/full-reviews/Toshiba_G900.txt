Toggle navigation Victor Hurdugaci. Blog Projects About. Windows Mobile 6.5 on Toshiba G900. Tutorial Review Toshiba Portege G900 Windows Mobile Windows Mobile 6.5 WM PDA ROM Upgrade. Ask people about the ROM you want to install. Make sure it did not brake any phone. The phone's battery must be at least 50% charged (better 100%) Make sure you have and UPS. Or a laptop with good battery because if you cancel the process after it started the results might be unexpected. Make sure the USB cable is firmly connect and is not broken! Get the ROM Get SuperRUU Run SuperRUU on a 32 bit Windows machine Select the ROM image and check the "OS" radio button Click "Upgrade target". Turn off the phone and start it while pressing the left softkey. A red screen should appear informing you that you need USB connection. Connect the phone to the PC running SuperRUU and the upgrade process should start. Do not interrupt it!!! It takes about two minutes.. Before writing anything else I must warn all readers that changing the operating systems on your mobile will void the warranty. If the upgrade process fails the phone might be damaged and no service will fix that for free. Do it on your own risk and make sure the following list is satisfied:. I cannot be made responsible for any damages caused directly or indirectly by this article.. On PortegeClub.com there is a WM 6.5 ROM Release Candidate for the G900. Because PortegeClub is not always working I uploaded the ROM on my server and you can download it from this link. It is not the kitchen version (clean version) and it includes some software but it is reasonable and it is not bloated.. WM6.5 brings a new startup logo and animation and a lot of other visual changes.. The first thing you will notice after startup is the new redesigned Today screen which supports widgets just like the HTC home screen. It's aspect is nice but you will find out soon that it cannot be customized. The only item supporting customization is the favorites widget :( Like usual there are widgets for time, messages, calls, pictures and music. Also you can use the classical Today screen items but you will use the eye-candy widgets. What I really enjoyed is that you can scroll through items by moving your finger over the screen in any region not just on the right side - this is a nice addition and also works for menus.. Another major interface change is the start menu. Well it is no longer MENU, it's a start screen that displays shortcuts to applications and phone settings. They are all arranged in the well-known WM6.5 combs and have a nice aspect. You can also scroll through items with your finger and when you get to the top/bottom of the menu there is a visual bounce effect that creates a realistic sensation. What is hard here is to navigate with the hardware DPad through items because pressing right many times cycles through a "row" of the comb and is not going the lower items. You must use all directions to navigate.. There are some other major visual changes but I don't have screenshots for them. The first thing is the unlock screen which has an object that must be slide in order to unlock the phone just like on iPhone. The second are the menus that are larger and more "finger-friendly" - you can navigate easily with the finger through them.. On my G900 screen rotation took almost 10 seconds (from portrait to landscape). While using the PDA in landscape the icons seemed crowded, hard to follow and the Today screen was not so good looking.. Because it is not an official release I cannot say it works bad. There could be "unofficial" reasons why this is not working properly. Anyhow, I haven't seen other major changes except the interface. The problem with interface changes is that you get used to them quickly and then you start to see what is not working. The ringtones are corrupted in this ROM and the SD card is disconnecting after a few hours so I reverted the ROM to a kitchen version of Windows Mobile 6.1 - you should try the 6.5, it's a nice experience!.

more ... more .... more ... more .... posted by PhoneArena Team. Camera: As almost all other phones on the market nowadays, the Portege G900 comes with built-in digital camera. The lens is located on the back in a circular window, where also the flash is hidden. It starts for whole 5 seconds after the (shortcut) button is pressed which is very slow, and shows interface in either portrait or landscape orientation. It can be rotated according to your taste, and unlike the G500 in both cases the text menu will be correctly oriented. The options allow you to choose the white balance (environment) setting or apply color effects. There are 3 levels of compression (quality) and 5 resolutions (sizes) for the pictures, with the biggest being 1600x1200 pixels or total of 2 Megapixels. 3 seconds are needed to save a picture of the highest possible quality which is way better result than the start. The quality of the images is what is expected from that type of camera – the detail is average, the colors have slight purple nuance but are relatively close to the real and the exposure is correct most of the time. Indoors the quality decreases with the reducing of the light, and best results will be obtained in bright room. The phone has a flash, but like almost all LED flashes is not of great benefit. Multimedia: Portege is equipped with the standard mobile version of Windows Media Player. It is a multimedia player for music and video files. MP3 format is supported, as well as WMA and WAV. After updating the library with files, all supported types are found, and they can be added to playlists. This function is not well implemented and organizing them is quite hard. Songs can be viewed by artist, album and genre, as these are taken from the ID3 tag of the files. The supported video formats are MPEG4/H.263, WMV and 3GP, while the quality of the latter is pretty low. They can be viewed in fullscreen but the high-resolution screen shows that the quality of this videos is not enough. Although the processor is not very fast, we are happy that no frames are skipped. Unfortunately you cannot playback video in MPEG 4/H.264 format which gives the best results. We tried to play WMV movie with resolution near to the one of the G900’s display (848x496) but what we got was a frame in a few seconds, not a video. Unfortunately the processor of the G900 cannot play videos that would suit the display as they are big in size. The options buttons (next/previous, Play/Pause, etc.) are small and inconvenient both during Music and Video playback. When audio files are played, the video visualization window is still displayed, which is a lapse as it only takes up place on your screen. You can have these problems solved by adding new skins for the Media Player or by using another music player. Although the speaker is located on the back, which is the reason the quality and volume decrease when the phone is put on a table. The speaker isn’t powerful and you will easy miss a call if a song is set as a ringtone and you don’t feel the vibration. To listen to music we would prefer to use headphones connected to the 2.5mm stereo jack or wireless ones using Bluetooth and A2DP profile. Software: The Toshiba G900 has 128MB ROM and 128MB RAM while most other PPC phones have 64 MB ROM. Internal memory capacity can be expanded through the miniSD card slot. WM for PPC provides unlimited capabilities for installing software. The only restrictions are the memory available and the hardware of the phone. The first problem is easily solved by getting a memory card as there are miniSD cards with capacity of up to several GB. Every WM6 Professional phone comes with programs that are modified, “pocket” versions known PC applications. Such programs are the mobile versions of ( Microsoft ) Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Internet Explorer, Explorer, Media Player, etc. The Office applications allow you to view and edit documents of the most-used types and the phone opens them without any error. Even a complicated Excel document with a few sheets is not a problem. Unlike many other PPC phones, the G900 doesn’t come with PDF reader but one can be installed later. Many more programs could be downloaded from third party sources, too as this is a smartphone. There are numerous programs created for this platform, almost as much as the ones intended for PCs with Windows operating system. The most popular are the various utilities for personalizing the PPC, multimedia players, file explorers, Instant Messengers, etc. You can download third party applications to be used instead of the preloaded ones. We thought that G900 won’t be able to run most of the applications for this OS, but it is not so. We tried Skype, Agile Messenger, Deepfish and they ran with no problem. A game designed for QVGA and VGA displays opened and used almost the whole screen but we experienced problem with TomTom 6 which didn’t work on the large display.. Toshiba PORTEGE G900 Compare. posted on 20 Oct 2010, 01:55. Mind you I just discovered this site last week and just love it, but how does this phone get a 9.5 rating in connectivity when it only connects on one band in the USA, and then no high speed data? Perhaps the editors could consider splitting connectivity ratings between Europe, Asia, and the USA with different numbers for each? Oh, and is just me, or is the USA still waiting for a fast 3G data phone with a screen big enough to actually surf the real web? QVGA just doesn't cut it, and I was waiting for this review hoping this was the phone that would do it, but I'm disappointed again.. posted on 29 Aug 2007, 11:28. there is no way it lasts ... how did they say it ? ...

We just did it with i-mate, so let's give Toshiba the (much shorter) roundup treatment. They certainly deserve the attention for coming back to the PocketPC fold after a two and a half year hiatus.

Ask a Question Start a Discussion. Tell us about your experience with our site. Auto email update...via WiFi (Toshiba G900, WM6). I'm trying to get my G900 to fetch mail on a schedule via WiFi.. Setting up a mail account with a schedule is no problem and works well. What I can't manage is to make this schedule use the WiFi connection rather than a cellular one.. When the phone is switched off, the device switches on to the schedule I've set up and even starts to initialise the WiFi connection, but doesn't get any mail.. What I believe to be happening is that the Messaging application is being triggered but finds that there is no cellular connection so halt on an error before the WiFi connection can be established. (This is certainly what happens when I try to reproduce. the problem manually, but I can't say what the phone is really doing in unattended mode with the screen off.). My glib assumption is that I need to find a way of either making the Messaging application explicitly wait for. WiFi to be ready for use or at least to delay shutting down for a few seconds to allow the WiFi connection to establish.. At the moment, however, I don't think this is possible.. Does anyone have any bright ideas?. I have the same question (0). Just press start and enjoy a true mobile experience. When you have your mail set to send/recieve when using your phone, what settings are you using?. If you decide to use Wi-Fi .... What is the schedule you use for checking your email?. (I hope I've asked enough for me to try to set my mail the same way and then I'll see if I get the same results). In reply to Jack Cook - aka Help_Line's post on July 23, 2007. The mail settings are obviously simple - 'Check mail every x minutes' selected (for testing, I'm using the minimum. As for connection settings, this is where I'm falling down I think.. The phone is configured for my WiFi setup, a fairly standard router setup with WEP. (Connection normally takes 3-5 seconds from power up). In the Connections menu, under My ISP (which is selected), I have no modems configured. (To my mind this ensures that no GPRS/3G form of connection is possible. There are no WiFi options in this area.). As I say, finding out what's going on in unattended mode is next to impossible so what I've done to try and simulate the position is to power up the device then manually select Send/Receive What I see on the status line is a brief indication of 'Connecting...'. All of this, while the WiFi is still connecting.. FWIW, when I do want to use GPRS (infrequently), I have a seperate Network setup containing the GPRS configuration which I select in place of 'My ISP'.. In reply to feathers2's post on July 23, 2007. Just press start and enjoy a true mobile experience. If I am reading this correctly, I believe the issue is here in your step 2:. In the Connections menu, under My ISP (which is selected) , I have no modems configured. (To my mind this ensures that no GPRS/3G form of connection is possible. There are no WiFi options in this area.)". If you have it set under MY ISP, that is how it will want to connect.. For you to use the WiFi, you will need to change the setting from MY ISP to WORK. Go to START, SETTINGS, CONNECTIONS, click the ADVANCED tab, press SELECT NETWORKS, change it from My ISP to WORK.. I expect that you will now be able to connect and get your mail.. Of course, when you want to get your mail via your provider, you will need to change that setting back to MY ISP. on my Treo drinking a cup of coffee at Honey Dew. In reply to Jack Cook - aka Help_Line's post on July 24, 2007. No, I'm afraid the results from this configuration are exactly the same for me.. Is there something somewehere I can set up to explicitely require a WiFi connection?. In reply to feathers2's post on July 25, 2007. Sorry, a brief answer there borne out of frustration.. I believe there must be something fundamental I'm missing here as I can't understand why this should be so difficult for me to achieve!. I configured both 'Internet' access and 'Private Network' access to use 'My Work Network' which is what I nderstand you to have been suggesting, but I don't understand why this should have diffferent results from using the 'My ISP' settings (it doesn't).. Neither have any modems or contact details configured within them so I don't understand why selecting one rather than the other should have any impact on the ability of my device to conncet via WiFi. Why should selecting 'Work' mean that the Messaging app. will wait around for a WiFi conncetion to establish itself befor atempting to fetch mail where selecting 'My ISP' won't?. In reply to feathers2's post on July 25, 2007. Just press start and enjoy a true mobile experience. Is there something somewehere I can set up to explicitely require a WiFi connection?. Well if you have it set to use WORK rather than My ISP it will connect via WiFi but you will have to leave the WiFi turned on as far as I know.. I don't know if there is a 3rd party app that will do what you want .... In reply to Jack Cook - aka Help_Line's post on July 26, 2007. At the moment, if I select either 'My Work Network' or 'My ISP' in the Connections settings then I need to leave WIFi on and leave the device on if I want this to work.. If I switch the device off (or allow it to switch off) then Messaging doesn't manage to achieve anything in the background 'Unattended Mode' i.e. waking up and running with the screen off.. In reply to feathers2's post on July 26, 2007. As a last ditch effort to get this going, I'll try and. restate what i'm doing with a bit more detail.. trying to get my Toshiba G900 WM6 phone to fetch email on a schedule (half hourly) from a specific account via WiFi. I'm trying to do this without leaving the phone on all the time.. b) Connect to my wireless router automatically. c) Go out to the internet and. From the evidence of the flashing lights on my router, it's clear that the device is waking up on schedule and connecting to the router correctly. I have no problems with the settings and configuration in this area.. the mail account is not a problem and works well when I connect to it manually.. So the problem I am having involves tying the email application into the wireless network. There is simply no setting for this as far as I can see. regardless of what is configured under Select Networks on the Connections Settings page, I have the same problem.. I believe that there is fundamentally no way of forcing a connection to use WiFi (or any other network 'card'). PPC/WM2003 the messaging app waited for a few seconds before deciding that no netwok was available, which allowed time for a WiFi connection to form from switch on. WM6 appears not to be able to do this. The moment an attempt to get mail commences. without an already established network connection, it is terminated with the message 'Error Synchronizing'.. I assume that this is what is happening in unattended mode when the mail fetch attempts fail.. assumption is still that I need to find a way of. making the WM6 Messaging application explicitly wait for. at least to wait for a few seconds (like WM2003 did) before giving up and declaring an error.. At the moment, however, I don't think this is possible. Has WM6 had this ability removed? Is my problem because this is a phone so the OS doesn't want to use WiFi?. In reply to feathers2's post on July 28, 2007. Just press start and enjoy a true mobile experience. That was a very clear explanation .... I'm not sure what the solution is but I am looking (and testing on my device).. If I can't find a solution, I am going to send this off to a friend that might be able to offer a solution.. In your settings, what are you using as your connection settings?. In reply to Jack Cook - aka Help_Line's post on July 29, 2007. Given that I've hard reset the device this week to see if that helped, I have very little configured in my connection settings.. Under WiFi, my access point is configured (with WEP) - connection normally takes 2-3 seconds. Other than that, I have nothing configured at all, connection wise.. Under Connections, I have nothing since I haven't re-entered my GPRS configuration stuff since the reset. To be clear, neither 'My ISP' nor 'My Work Network' are configured with any settings at all so I can effectively use the two interchangably will equal. Buy online, pick up in store.
