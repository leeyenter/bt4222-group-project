alcatel Fierce XL (Windows) - user opinions and reviews. Pages: 1 2 ». I've been using this phone for several weeks and it's holding up very good knowing it has such a small Snapdragon processor. Recently I updated to the Windows 10 Mobile Fall Creators Update, Build Version 1709; OS Build 10.0.15254.1. I'm using a Samsung 128 GB sd card in it which makes the File Explorer load a little slow while strolling, but Groove Music along with the other media apps hold up suprisingly good! The screen feels a little sticky but has fairly good resolution. The camera resolution sucks along with it loading slow! But very nice phone otherwise!. G, 16 Sep 2017 Don't get to excited, if you are using the Windows Insider Program. more Thanks for the reply! I never ran Windows Insider but thought I might with this phone, but now I guess I won't. You said you might get another phone?.........make sure you keep it Windows!!!:). #1 Windows Phone fan, 05 Sep 2017 I'm getting a Alcatel Fierce XL in the next couple weeks for $40. more Don't get to excited, if you are using the Windows Insider Program. My phone will only updates under Current branch. The fast or slow hasn't worked in four months. The overall phone is not bad, but I get the feeling that we will be buying another phone shortly.. I'm getting a Alcatel Fierce XL in the next couple weeks for $40. Right now I have a Samsung Ativ S Neo (Windows. The reason I'm getting this phone. is because it is a Windows 10 Mobile. a Microsoft Lumia 650 but the price was a little high. I was watching YouTube videos of the Fierce XL and it seemed. everyone's biggest problem about Windows 10 Mobile is the. app gap! Personally I don't think it's that bad with my 8.1,. and my brother has a Microsoft Lumia 640 (Windows 10. Mobile) and he doesn't complain about it either!:) So if you're. looking into buying a Windows Phone and the app gap is what. you're worried about, go ahead and buy that Windows because. you'll always be able to find an app somewhere in the Store. that'll make up for the other app on iOS or Android!. quick reply, which of the slots are for the simcard slot?. Ryan, 03 Feb 2017 I had a Lumia 640 and switched to this phone. I am a Windows Phone Fan. more Next year when a 2 year old phone will be dropped from support from Microsoft ,you will stop being a Windows fan.. I had a Lumia 640 and switched to this phone. I am a Windows Phone Fan. However, after a period of 6 months, I am going back to my Lumia 640. Personally the phone and the Apps are made for Lumia aka Microsoft Products. In addition to this : I purchased my Lumia as a AT&T phone, XDA shows how to Flash the Rom to T mobile. Suddenly I had a phone that works as it should on T mobile, It is a long process but well worth it. So if your a windows phone fan : Get Lumia or Microsoft based phones. The Apps DO NOT work correctly on other brands and limited. Even the Camera Apps both at 8 Mega pixel, the Lumia is Way above in quality and over all speed. I just wish I would have gotten a XL. However the 1520 for AT&T does not have LTE support for T mobile as the band is off and no wireless charging , NEW : you can turn on the T mobile Band for the Lumia 1520, Saving money to get me one!!! the super phone! No Phone to date has the specs of this phone!!! Check the Specs of the Lumia 1520, : Special info : there are 1520.1, 1520.2, 1520.3 versions. The .3 is for T Mobile. At&T Rom Version is 940 T mobile is 938. Have a Good Day Windows People!. Seems like a good and honest phone.. Dearest all.With this price tag and specifications,very good for children to know what Microsoft Windows 10 is!!!Why!!!?An average income person worldwide must sell their house to buy one of those Microsoft $3000+ tablets !!!So,Alcatel (of China now!) has done a good job!!A Windows smartphone under $ 80 much lesser selling someone,s house!!!So,tasting Windows is fun too,while android dominance is above 95%/ of all smartphone products!!!Amazing!No!!!?Omid12Omidvar,.....

I'd like to get it running the Insider Builds.. ***Moderator's Note: This post has been moved to the most appropriate category***. I have the same question (3). We have the answer about the WDRT, but no word on when the insider is going to be open to us.. there is "support" but I can not seem to get it to work. I have to click "My device was not detected" and then I follow the directions it gives me to place my phone in "flash mode"...but it still does not detect my phone. wanted to roll back to the original. .63 build the Fierce XL came with after trying he new Fast Ring Build on it. But now I cant am stuck on the Fast Ring Build.. In reply to JoeyStilson's post on March 7, 2016. I don't have the expertise to give you much help with the Recovery Tool, bu can I ask why you're rolling back? I did a hard reset after going to 14267. And with the exception of a few minor bugs, it runs great. Or at least try a hard reset then the Recovery. Sorry I can' offer more help.. Buy online, pick up in store.

The Fierce XL with Windows 10 Mobile is only ever going to appeal to a small audience, and while it provides a solid, yet basic experience, for many it doesn't do enough.. The Alcatel Fierce XL with Windows 10 Mobile won't be a handset which sweeps the nation, rather it'll likely only appeal to a small subset of consumers. And Alcatel is fine with that.. It's exclusive to T-Mobile, and there are currently over one million customers on the carrier who have a Windows Phone 7 or 8 device - devices which can't be upgraded to Microsoft's latest software, Windows 10 Mobile.. That means there are Windows fans with handsets running old software, which is where the Fierce XL comes in.. As you may already know, Alcatel already has an Android variant of the phone under the same name out in the US - and the two handsets share a lot of the same specs, and price.. Alcatel's first Windows 10 phone is available to Un-carrier customers with T-Mobile's interest-free financing for $139.99, or $0 down ($5.84/23 months, $5.67 for 24th month).. For that you get a 5.5-inch HD display, 1.1GHz quad-core processor, 2GB of RAM, 16GB of internal storage, microSD slot, 8MP rear camera and 2MP front facing camera. That's not a bad line up of specs considering the price point.. The bright blue model I got hands on with is reminiscent of the Lumia design language, not to mention the iPhone 5C too, and it feels solid in the hand. The shiny plastic offers little in the way of grip, but it's still pretty easy to handle even with its larger screen.. It's a little on the chunky side at 9.6mm thick, but at least the power and volume keys on the right fall nicely under finger. At the end of the day it's a functional design, which is what you want from a budget handset.. The quad-core processor and 2GB of RAM provide a decent slug of power, and I found Windows 10 Mobile to be smooth and responsive with good app load times.. It's not the perfect amount of power though, as Alcatel has had to drop Microsoft's Continuum functionality from the handset as it doesn't have the grunt to run it.. Continuum is a feature in Windows 10 that allows you to use your phone as a Windows computer when plugged into a monitor or screen using a special dock - but you won't be doing that with the Fierce XL.. I found the 8MP rear camera was pretty good, coping with the questionable lighting at the Alcatel stand, but the 2MP front camera is something to avoid. It's horribly grainy, which will make your selfies suck.. If the Alcatel Fierce XL with Windows 10 Mobile takes your fancy you can pre-order it now, with stock arriving at the start of February.. For those wedded to Microsoft's ecosystem but currently stuck on Windows Phone 7 or 8 the Fierce XL with Windows 10 Mobile is an affordable way to keep your smartphone in line with your computer and Xbox .. Those who haven't bought into Microsoft's world however will likely find themselves drawn to the Android variant of the handset which can boast a wider range of apps - or to a completely different brand.. The Alcatel Fierce XL with Windows 10 Mobile is only ever going to appeal to a small audience, and while it provides a solid, yet basic experience, for many it doesn't do enough..

Alcatel OneTouch Fierce XL receiving Windows 10 Mobile Anniversary Update. Alcatel OneTouch Fierce XL owners, another Windows 10 Mobile update is coming your way.. An update to Windows 10 Mobile build 14393.67 is now hitting T-Mobile’s Alcatel OneTouch Fierce XL. This is the Windows 10 Mobile Anniversary Update , which is hitting T-Mo’s Fierce XL around one week after it started arriving on unlocked Windows phones.. This update is a bit more significant than previous Fierce XL updates because it adds several new features. Those include tweaks like a camera shortcut that replaces the back button on the lock screen and media controls on the lock screen, too. There are also new and updated emoji, an updated Settings app, the ability to prioritize notifications in Action Center, a new Skype app, and an updated Windows Store, among other things.. So yeah, this is a big update for the Fierce XL. If you haven’t gotten it yet, you can manually check for the update right now by going into Settings > Update & security > Phone update > Check for updates..

I updated my Fierce XL last night. I haven’t really explored for changes too much yet, but one of the things I noticed is that the device seems a bit more zippy. Apps are loading and closing a little faster.. Yet the Microsoft Lumia 640 still even lacks the Windows 10 update, still stuck on 8.1.. I still have a 640 laying around. I still use it alot at home for non calling /texting. It’s a great device that T-Mobile utterly just abandoned. Very poor business practice on behalf of T-Mobile. We got the Lumia 640 for my son during the 3-month window T-Mobile was selling them, and it was great. We waited and waited for the Windows 10 update, but it’s just been abandoned. Bought him an Android phone instead. Sick of waiting, and I’ll never understand why T-Mobile threw away such a good, affordable option…. They did the same with the Lumia 925 which I also had at one point and is still probably the favorite Windows Phone I’ve owned. That was abandoned by T-Mobile as well. Quite frankly, I’m shocked that they have supported the Fierce XL to this point. I’ve started complaining to T-Mobile on Twitter and other channels in the hopes that maybe the support will come. I refuse to let a carrier bully me into an Android or iOS device so I went with an international Lumia 640 XL. I get update support, no carrier branding, and everything else. But they refuse to make a T-Mobile Tuesdays app. At least you can get unRadio, but for a carrier that claims to be an “un-carrier” they’re acting an awful lot like Verizon by refusing support.. I’m not getting another Windows phone. I had one myself and loved it but the lack of apps and ever dwindling support from Microsoft got to me so I moved to an iPhone which I love. My mom is getting frustrated with her Windows Phone as well and I know the next phone she gets will not be an Windows Phone. It’s pretty much a dead OS now though and I expect Microsoft to pull the plug on it in the next one-two years.. The simplicity of Windows Phone was nice, but the lack of apps,and lack of OS support from Microsoft was a deal breaker for me.. The OS is really good and solid but yeah the apps and the fact that less and less is on Windows Phone and that Microsoft is about to dump it pretty much makes Windows Phone devices pointless these days. I won’t be getting another one nor recommending them to anybody. Microsoft just really screwed up what was a really solid Mobile OS.. Microsoft is not going to dump it. It’s always going to be in ios & androids shadow. But it’s not going anywhere despite what all the “experts” on the internet say. I don’t believe that for a second no matter what Microsoft says all signs are pointing to them dropping it sometime in 2017 maybe 2018 at the latest.. We’ll see who’s right and who wrong when that time rolls around. That’s all that can be said at this time. Microsoft has always been good at delivering a clean, smooth experience but leaving us hanging when you drill down to the truth of the matter. I would only recommend Windows Phone to someone that can work with what it offers out of the box. If I were to ever return, it would strictly be for Microsoft’s own services, not for third party apps. Where WP 8.1 dropped the ball on Microsoft’s own services, W 10 M seems to finish what was started. I’d never go back to WP 8.1, seeing how Xbox Video, Xbox Music, and the Maps application worked on those devices. I might go to W 10 M, if Microsoft can ever get AT&T to offer it through GoPhone again. I don’t see that happening, as AT&T is dumping the W 10 M devices onto Cricket. Microsoft should have integrated aspects of MixRadio into Groove Music, like Google did with Google Play Music when they bought out Songza. But Microsoft wanted to compete with Apple Music instead, which isn’t even that good.. Lack of OS Support? Name another OS that has a program like Microsoft’s Insider Program. If you want to gripe about apps, that’s more than fair. Yes lack of OS support because Microsoft told everyone with a WP 8.1 on 512 MB RAM to go f_ themselves when it came to upgrading to W 10 M, which we couldn’t even get a deprecated version of. Sure, you could go rouge and use the Insider Program to force W 10 M on your device, but you shouldn’t have to do that when you had reassurances from Microsoft that you would get the upgrade. You don’t have that s_ from Android or iOS.. I actually ended up using the Insider Program to upgrade my 635 512 MB to Windows 10. I do have to wait a few seconds here and there, but that is to be expected.. You need to install Upgrade Advisor, MS app. That app prepares your phone for the Windows 10 Mobile upgrade.. Upgrade adviser does nothing, it’s on my grandmother’s phone and during a check all it does is just continue to say Windows 10 isn’t available for her device still.. The closet phone to the Lumia 640 you are going to get at T Mobile is the Alcatel Fierece XL that is still being updated, supported, and sold. The only downside is the camera sucks on the Alcatel, I had to turn off the flash it made the pictures look horrible especially in low light areas.. This will be great, once I get my phone back from service……. I updated my Alcatel Fierce XL Windows phone to the anniversary update. I am having issues with the app Age of Empires Castle Siege crashing when trying to open. Sometimes it will open but it usually crashes. I have uninstalled and reinstalled still having issue.. You must be on the Fast or slow ring to get that update since they have not released it to people who are not on the insider program.. I profit about 6,000-8,000 dollars a month with an online job i found on internet. So if you are willing to complete basic freelance work for several hours a day at your home and get good paycheck while doing it… Then this job opportunity is for you… KORTA.NU/NDe bhg754ewq. - Any -

http:/ / www.phonescoop.com/ articles/ article.php? a=17385. Review: Alcatel Fierce XL with Windows for T-Mobile. Alcatel ported Windows 10 to its Fierce XL handset and the result is a low-cost point of entry to Microsoft's ecosystem of productivity apps. The Fierce XL with Windows in a simple smartphone that impresses and bores at the same time. The Alcatel Fierce XL is one of the least-expensive Windows 10 handsets on the market. It's also the only one being sold officially by T-Mobile. If you're on a tight budget and already invested in Microsoft's ecosystem, the Fierce XL is a low-cost point of entry.. The Fierce XL is a pretty blunt device. It's big, heavy, and relies on a pedestrian design that is plain almost to a fault. It's also sort of a copycat.. The XL first arrived last fall as an Android handset. This version of the phone runs Windows 10 from Microsoft, but otherwise the hardware is identical. The only other phone maker that has stuffed Windows into a former Android handset in the U.S. is HTC, which did the same thing with the One M8. (Honestly, I'm not sure why we haven't seen more of this from Android phone makers.). This handset is a simple slab. The shape and overall appearance are rather boring. The four corners are rounded nicely, but the side edges have a generic curve to them and the back panel is flat and lacking personality. The glass of the front panel is fitted into a plastic frame that sits in a polycarbonate shell. The most exciting thing the XL has going for it is the color. Alcatel dropped the gray coloring of the Android XL in favor of a cyan rear shell for the Windows XL. Too bad Nokia did this years ago with the Lumia 800 and myriad other handsets. The XL's color strikes me as a bit unoriginal.. Most would classify the XL has a phablet. The 5.5-inch screen and chunky bezels push the phone out in all directions. It's 5.98 inches tall, 3.06 inches wide, 0.37 inches thick, and weighs in at a mighty 6.14 ounces. The XL is definitely toward the bigger end of the handset sizing spectrum.. If you have small hands, the XL may not be the best choice for you; it's a two-handed phone for sure. The phone's smooth plastic skin means it won't catch on your pocket liners, but the XL's footprint means you always know it's in your pocket. The build quality and materials are decent, but not the best I've seen. I saw some variation in the uniformity of the polycarbonate shell, but the seams were mostly tight.. Alcatel took a straightforward approach to crafting the XL's front surface. A chrome grille covers the earpiece speaker above the display and the three capacitive buttons are painted onto the glass below the display. These are the only things that are noticeable from afar. The screen when off is a dark gray that stands out from the black glass around it, which is a characteristic I don't like on any phone. The screen lock button and volume toggle are placed on the right edge of the phone. The screen lock button is closer to the top. I wish their positions were reversed, as I often found myself hitting the volume button when I meant to wake the XL. The buttons are both narrow strips with low profiles. The profiles could be better, as could the travel and feedback. The headset jack is built into the top edge and the micro USB port is built into the bottom. This is a pretty standard configuration. There are no controls along the left edge, which is smooth.. The rear surface is mostly flat and empty space. The camera module is positioned close to the top edge and has a chrome rim that makes it stand out visually. The rim has a physical profile, as well, and protrudes a bit from the phone's back surface.. The entire back panel lifts off easily thanks to a notch carved into the lower corner. Despite the removable panel and sheer size of this phone, the battery is sealed inside. Slots for memory and SIM cards are available underneath the cover.. The Alcatel Fierce XL is a perfectly functional and serviceable piece of hardware, it's just a bit uninspired to my eyes.. The display measures 5.5 inches across the diagonal and has 720p HD resolution. That gives it a pixel density of about 267ppi, which isn't bad considering the phone's low price. I compared it side-by-side with the quad HD screen of the Lumia 950 and the Fierce XL's display holds its own against the far more pixel-rich flagship. The XL's screen delivers pleasing color, nice contrast, and sharp (enough) on-screen elements, such as text and icons. I was only able to spot pixels if I held the phone right up to my eyes. I did have to set the brightness up all the way to use the phone outdoors, but viewing angles are quite good.. The Fierce XL operates on T-Mobile's LTE network and I found it to perform on par with other phones I've tested on T-Mobile in the metro NYC area. Calls generally connected on the first attempt and didn't disconnect as I traveled around via car. T-Mobile's LTE service was always available to the phone while I reviewed the device and data speeds were decent. I've seen faster speeds on other T-Mobile devices, but the Fierce XL did well enough.. I was pleased with the XL's call quality, which I'd rate as above average for a T-Mo phone. The earpiece produced crisp, clear voices that were a breeze to hear thanks to the solid amount of volume delivered by the phone. I had no trouble holding conversations at home, in busy coffee shops, when walking around town, or in the car. Two dozen screaming 9-year-old girls were, however, able to overwhelm the XL's earpiece when I used it to order pizza for my daughter's birthday party; I had to step outside for that call. On the plus side, the guy taking my order on the other end of the phone said he could hear me, chaos be damned.. The speakerphone isn't quite that good. Quality is solid enough, but volume drops significantly. I was still able to use it in quiet places with no issue, but loud spaces will more easily overwhelm it.. Ringers and alerts had no trouble finding my ears, but the vibrate alert is far too subtle.. I'm rather stunned that such a large phone has a mere 2,500 mAh power cell inside. However, the phone pushes through a full day on a consistent basis. I was worried the XL wouldn't last to dinner, but found the battery still had plenty of life left come bedtime. The XL's lower-resolution screen and entry-level processor probably help keep power demand low. Alcatel did a good job tuning the battery to the Fierce XL's needs.. Windows 10 includes some pretty powerful power-management tools, though I doubt you'll need to tap into them. The battery dashboard offers a detailed look at what apps are using power and estimates how much time remains. Moreover, you can control when the battery saver software kicks in. You can even set exceptions, allowing some apps to perform at full power even if the battery saver is on.. The XL doesn't include rapid charging, nor wireless charging.. I didn't encounter any issues when using the XL's various other radios. The Bluetooth radio paired with my car, headsets, and PCs without problem. Call quality through a mono headset was decent. Music sounded OK when played via Bluetooth speaker, but I've heard much better. The XL doesn't have an NFC radio, so I had to pair everything manually (oh, the horror!). The GPS radio worked well with the mapping software on the XL. The phone was able to locate me swiftly, but accuracy varied a bit, often stretching to 100 feet or more. Most phones can pinpoint you down to about 25 feet; the best know where you are within 5-10 feet. I was surprised to see the XL's accuracy a bit soft, even when using GPS, WiFi, and cell triangulation for location. At least Windows' mapping software is great.. The WiFi radio pushed bits back and forth effortlessly.. Hands-On with the Alcatel OneTouch Fierce XL with Windows. Making good on a promise it made last year, Alcatel has shown off its first Windows 10 smartphone. Rather than start from scratch, the copy repurposed the Fierce XL handset, swapping Android for Windows.. Alcatel Adds Windows 10 to the Fierce XL.

ZTE's low-cost Warp 7 finds itself amongst some fierce competition in the middle of Boost Mobile's lineup of Android smartphone. This big-screened handset has conservative styling, but scores well on core functions such as call quality and battery life.. Alcatel Fierce XL with Windows 10. 2 GB RAM 2,500 mAh battery. Headphone Jack (3.5mm), Water-Resistant, Memory Card Slot. Nice review, seems straightforward and balanced. One thing Windows Phone and Windows 10 Mobile reviewers always seem to miss is the phenomenal capability of Cortana combined with either a Bluetooth headset or earbuds for safe, efficient hands-free use, either while driving, or working around the house: 1) Listen to and REPLY TO texts without touching the phone, using strictly voice. 2) Dictate emails through the headset. 3) Bring up specific webpages without touching the phone, for example "Open webpage Sigalert.com" and it displays the page without requiring any touch input. 4) Initiate navigation without touching the phone: "Directions from current location to Cheesecake Factory in Pasadena, California"....

Display Colors Display Colors is refers to the number of different shades of colors that the screen is capable of displaying => 64K colors, 256K colors and 16 million colors, Obviously 16M is highest available range of colors and better than others.. Pixel Density Pixel Density (PPI) is refers to the concentration of pixels on a particular display, measured in pixels per inch (ppi). Pixel density is calculated by dividing the diagonal pixel resolution of a display by its diagonal size, higher pixel density better display quality.. Display Protection Display Protection => Gorilla Glass is a special alkali-aluminosilicate glass shield with exceptional damage resistance that helps protect mobile displays from scratches, drops, and bumps of everyday use, It is always better to go for a smartphone with Gorilla Glass for that added protection and peace of mind.. GPU GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is a single-chip processor designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display, This includes things such as lighting effects, object transformations, and 3D motion.. RAM (Memory) RAM (Random Access Memory) is a type of computer memory that can be accessed randomly, any byte of memory can be accessed without touching the preceding bytes that allows information to be stored and accessed quickly from random locations. RAM is the most common type of memory found in computer systems, smartphones, tablets and other electronic devices..

Flash Flash Light => There is commonly two types of flash lights are used in camera mobile phones, LED Flash (LED flash offers lower power consumption with drive circuitry that takes up very little room, LEDs can be strobed faster than any other light source), Xenon Flash (xenon flash produces an extremely intense full-spectrum white light for a very short duration). SIM SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) is a small card that contains mobile network subscriber's account information. This allows the phone using the card to attach to a mobile network. The SIM card is most commonly associated with GSM and UMTS mobile networks.
