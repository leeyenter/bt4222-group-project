I bought this phone on Amazon in March, thinking it's a bargain from a well-known Chinese company. And initially it did work well. So much so that I ordered one more of the same model as a gift to a dear one. The phone simply crashes without any warning. Either that or it heats up pretty fast and the battery then drains out lightning fast. I can't trust this phone and go anywhere. In theory, I am within warranty period and I could ask for a replacement. But the company has only one service centre in all of Bangalore. And that too is inconveniently, perhaps deliberately, located in far away Yelahanka. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Great phone under 5k. Great camera phone in this price range. Battery may disappoint for heavy users. Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars Completely horrible. Even though being under warranty the authorized dealer refused to fix it. First time he said 1700 to repair and when I went after 3 days, he said price will 4500/- for repairing (which is more than the price of the phone) and charged 300/- to check the phone.
