Video: Reseña Motorola Moto X Play. Video: Reseña Motorola Moto X Play. No se calienta bajo uso continuo. Cámara frontal sin ángulo amplio de visión. GPS es lento y tarda en localizarte. No tiene luz LED de notificaciones. Si buscas un teléfono que sin ser demasiado ostentoso cumpla con lo que un teléfono inteligente se supone que tiene que cumplir, este Motorola Moto X Play es uno de esos, un celular de batalla resistente y veloz en todos los sentidos.. El desempeño que uno espera de la gama media. La razón por la que este teléfono se ha ganado mi respeto. Una cámara que te va a servir para lo esencial. Ayuda a los usuarios a entender que calificación le das a este producto, selecciona el número de estrellas siendo 5 estrellas la calificación más alta.. El segundo teléfono de Motorola en llegar al mercado mexicano en 2015 fue el Moto X Play, un teléfono cuyo diseño ha dividido opiniones entre los usuarios. a los que se los he presentado porque a algunos gusta y a otros no tanto. Personalmente, no es mi diseño favorito, ya que el acabado en red le da un aspecto poco elegante y el tipo de plástico se ensucia fácilmente, sobre todo en el modelo color blanco que fue el que probé. Pero esa es sólo una opinión a título personal, ya que los detalles estéticos siempre dejo que los usuarios los juzguen pues no todos tenemos la misma percepción de lo que es “bonito”.. Respecto a lo que sí es más fácil calificar, que son los materiales empleados, quedo satisfecho, pues. el plástico de policarbonato que encuadra el cuerpo del teléfono tiene una apariencia metálica que lo hace lucir bien en el modelo color negro. Recordemos que México es uno de los países seleccionados en tener Moto Maker así que es posible elegir entre 16 colores diferentes de carcasas y diferentes colores de clips para combinar como mejor te parezca.. Si compras el Moto X Play en la página oficial de Motorola tienes la oportunidad de personalizarlo a tu gusto, pero si lo consigues en alguno de los distribuidores externos puedes conseguir el modelo doble SIM (utiliza Nano) lo cual ha resultado muy atractivo para distintos tipos de usuario que utilizan una SIM para llamadas y otra exclusivamente para consumo de datos móviles, lo cual puedes hacer en redes 4G LTE con este modelo.. A pesar de que las carcasas son removiese la batería no lo es, cuenta con un cuerpo completamente sellado con certificación IP52, por lo cual es muy importante que no lo pongas a pruebas extremas de agua, este nivel de certificación sólo lo hace resistente a salpicaduras y quizás acuatizajes accidentales.. es buena sin llegar a ser la mejor característica. Mide 5.5 pulgadas y tiene resolución Full HD con 403 pixeles por pulgada, así que no hay duda de que los videos y la navegación se disfrutan bastante, sin embargo, es buena y sólo eso, no destaca de entre los de su categoría por una característica especial. Quizás lo único que me resta apuntar en este sentido es que me agrada que teniendo una pantalla tan grande cuente con un cuerpo curveado en la parte trasera, que hace muy fácil sostener el teléfono, algo que he encontrado un poco complicado en otros celulares de dimensiones similares.. También está protegida con un cristal Gorilla Glass de tercera generación así que no te preocupes por tener que ponerle micas especiales si no quieres gastar de más o si no te gusta cómo se ven en un teléfono.. Tiene el procesador Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 de ocho núcleos (QuadCore 1.7 GHz + QuadCore 1.0 GHz), que es el mismo que utiliza el Sony Xperia M4 Aqua y el Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3, por lo cual podríamos decir que, a pesar de ser más caro que el resto, la diferencia en cuestión de desempeño no es aplastantemente superior. Al igual que sus competidores trabaja con 2 GB de RAM, pero lo que le ayuda a este teléfono a salir mejor calificado en las pruebas de rendimiento es que su sistema operativo es más puro que el de Alcatel y Sony, marcas que personalizan un poco más las capas de la plataforma para darle un sello único.. en materia de desempeño, velocidad, pantalla y diseño, el Moto X Play sea un teléfono que simplemente cumple lo que promete, sin ir más allá, pero eso cambia cuando hablamos de su batería la cual tiene una capacidad de 3630 mAh. Tal como lo comento en el video de la reseña, desde el Moto MAXX un teléfono no me dejaba tan satisfecho.. Su batería tarda máximo hora y media en cargarse de 0 a 100% gracias a un cargador turbo que ya viene integrado en la caja, lo cual es excelente porque aunque no tengas tiempo para cargarlo completamente, digamos sólo 20 minutos, el teléfono alcanza porcentajes de hasta 40% que se traducen en 4 horas de uso. Ahora que si hablamos de una carga completa el teléfono puede durar dos días sin ningún inconveniente, me pareció impresionante que en las noches que se ma olvidado ponerlo a cargar y veo que tiene 17% al día siguiente el teléfono amanece con 15% y ese porcentaje es suficiente para sobrevivir hasta el mediodía sin que tenga que quedarme sin teléfono en alguna emergecia.. No hay duda, este teléfono es el rey de las baterías no sólo de su categoría sino también cuando hablamos de la gama baja y alta. Otros teléfonos como los Note Galaxy han integrado baterías con mayor capacidad, sin embargo los recursos que consumen son más demandantes y por lo tanto no se traduce necesariamente en mayor duración.. Una de las razones por las que vale la pena hablar de su cámara es porque la compañía sabe que lo que a la gente le gusta escuchar es que en cada nueva generación tienen más megapixeles, en este caso hablamos de un salto hasta los 21 megapixeles, los cuales no son nada despreciables.. Sin embargo éste es un tema que ya hemos tratado en varias ocasiones, no hay que dejarnos llevar tanto por el número. El hecho de que ahora el Moto X Play tenga tal capacidad quiere decir que el tamaño de sus imágenes es mayor pero no precisamente que sea mejor que la cámara de menos megapixeles de Samsung Galaxy S6 edge o incluso el iPhone 6. ¿Toma buenas fotos? Sí, pero tanto la interfaz de la aplicación como la apertura del lente hacen que las fotografías tengan algunas limitantes.. Lo que quiero decir con esto es que si vas a estar en un exterior con muy buena iluminación natural vas a obtener resultados verdaderamente atractivos, con un detalle satisfactorio de texturas y colores, sobre todo si tienes el modo HDR activo, pero en el momento en el que intentes ponerte exigente con condiciones especiales te vas a encontrar con que no es la cámara de tus sueños. Con esto estoy hablando de fotografías de noche, selfies en lugares con escasa iluminación, objetos en movimiento y efectos de imagen originales. Lo cual tampoco creo que sea precisamente grave ya que no todas las personas están interesadas en hacer fotografía artística con sus celulares, sino que buscan algo que funcione para tomar fotos buenas con el menor esfuerzo, y para eso este teléfono funciona bien.. Me gusta el rumbo que están tomando los teléfonos de Motorola, dejando un lado el aspecto de diseño me parece que son teléfonos que cumplen con lo esencial: larga duración de batería, buena pantalla, navegación fluida, actualización de sistema operativo y buena cámara. En lo único que creo que es el mejor de lo mencionado es en batería, pero ojo, no debemos perder de vista que el teléfono cuesta 5 mil pesos menos que los que presumen superarlo sin tampoco tener una diferencia abismal.. Hablaba de que el teléfono se ve cara a cara con el Xperia M4 Aqua y el Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 por tener el mismo procesador y por lo tanto, ofrecer más o menos lo mismo, sin embargo en este sentido me parece que su rival más fuerte podría ser su hermano mayor: el Motorola Moto X Style, el cual tiene todos los beneficios de este Moto X Play pero con mejor características y con una diferencia de precio no tan grande que podría hacer dudar a los usuarios entre comprar el Play o ahorrar unos pesos más por tener lo más poderoso de la marca.. Pero dejaré esta carta abierta hasta que pueda poner bajo las mismas pruebas al Moto X Style que a pesar de ser una categoría arriba, tiene una capacidad de batería más baja y aunque durante su presentación nos dijeron que ambos están optimizados para durar lo mismo, estoy seguro que el Moto X Play seguirá ganando y que esa es la jugada de Motorola de haber sacado dos teléfonos tan similares al mismo tiempo sin que uno se coma al otro en ventas..

Video: Reseña Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+. Pantalla con colores muy vivos y texturas nítidas.. Protección Gorilla Glass en cristal trasero.. Precisión inconsistente en el lector de huellas.. La bocina está ubicada en un lugar impráctico.. Si tienes un Galaxy S6 Edge no es una actualización urgente, pero si estás en busca de un Android con todo lo que la tecnología móvil puede ofrecer hasta el momento, sí necesitas leer a detalle el siguiente análisis.. Un diseño que se presume solo. La experiencia de llevar un S6 edge+ en el bolsillo. Los accesorios: un tema cada vez más importante. Un nuevo Galaxy ha llegado a México y. aunque parece no ser completamente nuevo, sí promete robar muchas miradas dentro de la gama Premium. Su diseño está 100% inspirado en su antecesor, incluso, si no fuera por el hecho de que esta. versión “plus” es notablemente más grande que el S6 Edge normal, hasta podríamos decir que se ven como el mismo teléfono. En la parte superior ya no tiene el puerto infrarrojo pero eso es un detalle que sólo los más observadores notarían y que para ser franco, dudo mucho que sea algo que a la gente le parezca relevante.. La diferencia de dimensiones se deben a que la pantalla ahora es de 5.7 pulgadas, afortunadamente en la anchura no hay un crecimiento abismal, por lo cual, se puede sujetar con mucha firmeza con una sola mano, pero en lo largo sí se nota el cambio, ya que mide 15.4 cm, casi 1 cm más que el antecesor y que créanme sí. Personalmente me parece que el tamaño del S6 Edge es mucho más manipulable y menos estorboso pero también entiendo que hay muchas personas para las que el tamaño del teléfono (hablando específicamente de la pantalla) sí les convence más –cuando se ve y se siente grande.. Respecto a los materiales y acabados, como ya lo mencioné anteriormente, tenemos todo exactamente igual y mi opinión sigue siendo la misma: es un teléfono muy elegante, el más atractivo en cuestión de diseño que ha hecho la marca porque combina plástico, cristal y metal en un mismo cuerpo y a diferencia del. Xperia Z1, Z2 y Z3, no se le impregnan tan fácilmente las huellas dactilares. Sí sucede, pero es menos propenso.. El principal atractivo de la línea Edge es la curvatura de su pantalla por ambos lados y sí se ve muy original pero tampoco creo que sea lo que más vas a disfrutar del teléfono. Cuenta con un par de funciones que no son nuevas porque ya las habíamos visto en el primer S6 Edge: contactos frecuentes ordenados por colores, reloj de buró, sistema de notificaciones especial para los contactos frecuentes y acceso directo a las cinco aplicaciones más usadas.. Ésta última función sí resulta útil en el día a día,. ya que sólo tienes que deslizar tu dedo en la curvatura para abrir directamente Twitter, Facebook, Spotify, YouTube o lo que sea que utilices con más frecuencia pero mi punto central en este apartado es que a pesar de que es la característica que le da nombre al teléfono no esperes que tenga la súper innovación y que tampoco creas que hay una evolución en funciones respeto al anterior. En todo caso la mejor experiencia que he tenido con pantallas curvas en Galaxy sigue siendo la del Note 4 que tenía una curvatura más pronunciada por lo cual era posible –además de todo lo anterior– ver notificaciones y correr algunas aplicaciones especiales para esa parte de la pantalla.. Lo que considero uno de los principales atractivos del teléfono es la pantalla, resolución QHD (1440 x 2560 pixeles) con 518 ppi y tecnología Super AMOLED para un despligue de colores que hace que no importa si es un video precargado, de YouTube o uno que tú mismo grabaste con tu cámara, se vea impecable. Como extra también es importante decir que cuenta con Gorilla Glass de 4 generación en el cristal de atrás, razón por la que no se raya tan fácil (como sí sucede con los Xperia Z, por lo menos hasta la tercera generación).. No me cabe duda que llevar un teléfono como éste es tener las herramientas para hacer todo lo que se supone que un celular tiene que hacer. Si quieres tomar una fotografía el teléfono integra una cámara de 16 megapixeles que funciona muy bien tanto de día como de noche, incluso cuenta con un modo manual para poder tomar fotografías con características muy específicas que aquellos que apreciamos el arte de la imagen y dominamos los conceptos básicos de la foto –sin ser profesionales– disfrutaremos infinitamente. No es el único teléfono que tiene este modo manual pero si. a esto sumamos la apertura del sensor, el estabilizador óptico y la interfaz de la cámara sí te deja más satisfecho que modelos de otras marcas.. La cámara frontal también funciona perfecto con sus 5 megapixeles y debo confesar que aunque cuando empezaron a salir los primeros teléfonos con ángulo de visión amplio pensé que era un simple capricho, hoy que ya se está estandarizado en las cámaras frontales de muchos teléfonos, me molesta cuando abro la cámara frontal de uno y su ángulo de visión es el tradicional (cof cof, iPhone). La cereza en el pastel de este lente es que también tiene estabilizador óptico así que al grabar videos con la cámara frontal el movimiento es mínimo, algo muy atractivo para los que estamos metidos en aplicaciones como Instagram, Vine, Periscope e incluso para sacarle mejor provecho a la nueva función de Samsung para streaming vía YouTube.. Al momento de ver videos tuve el primer conflicto con el celular y es que a pesar de que la pantalla se ve muy bien y la calidad de sonido es buena (no la mejor para ser sinceros como presumieron durante su presentación) el diseño de las bocinas no me parece que sea el mejor logrado, sobre todo después de haber probado un par de teléfonos con doble bocina en donde se demuestra que tener un sistema doble de bocinas y colocarlas en la parte frontal del teléfono brinda una mejor experiencia. Entiendo que por la estética de este Galaxy no se presta, así que la solución es sujetar el teléfono tratando de no tapar con tu mano la bocina.. En cuestión de desempeño sólo tengo un “pero” qué ponerle. Por un lado no queda lugar a dudas que es un teléfono potente, cuenta con un procesador Exynos 7420 de ocho núcleos (1.5 GHz + 2.1 GHz) y una memoria RAM de 4 GB, lo cual es probablemente más una estrategia de mercadotecnia por intentar ser “el primero” o “el más poderoso” pero creo que en experiencia de usuario se sentía igual de veloz que modelos anteriores con 3 GB de RAM, sobre todo porque tampoco hubo una evolución abismal en el software del teléfono. En contraste, el teléfono no ha logrado solucionar por completo el problema de sobrecalentamiento que se siente en la parte trasera después de un rato de uso, y es que si bien lo sentí con menos intensidad que en el S6 Edge, aún es un tema que despierta desconfianza en los usuarios a los cuales me gustaría decirles que para su tranquilidad, fuera de un tema de temperatura, el teléfono no se traba o se reinicia a causa de esto.. Y aprovechando que estamos abordando los matices no tan positivos del teléfono otra cosa que no sentí tan precisa fue el detector de huellas dactilares que se integra en el botón de Home y que aunque tiene un potencial enorme con la introducción de Samsung y Android Pay, en México es casi como hablar de un cuento de hadas porque no es una tecnología que vayamos a tener pronto en el país. Para lo que nosotros podemos utilizar este botón principalmente es para el desbloqueo de la pantalla, y ahí fue cuando me percate que en. repetidas ocasiones, no me respondía bien al primer intento.. Samsung está construyendo un gran imperio tecnológico alrededor de sus celulares que es uno de sus divisiones más fuertes, así que considera que hoy en día tener un Samsung Galaxy significa tener la tentación de adquirir otros accesorios que están pensados para convivir perfectamente con el teléfono. - Cargador inalámbrico el cual toma apenas 90 minutos para cargar de 0 a 100% su batería de 3,000 mAh. - Teclado QWERTY físico para colocarse como aditamento especial. - Fundas, de todos los colores y funciones, desde smart covers hasta protecciones con batería extra..
