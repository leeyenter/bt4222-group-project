It's a quick and smooth experience using this phone for anything.\nFingerprint scanner\u2026 I always thought this was a bit of an over-the-top inclusion on phones but I love it now that I\u2019ve tried it. And on this phone, recognition is instant. Personally, the back-panel location is also optimal. I have set up both my index fingers and I am already used to using this feature and can't understand how I put up with entering a pattern or PIN for so long.\n\nThings I was worried about that are okay:EMUI seems okay to me, not sure why people hate it.\nBloat and customising and branding from my carrier is really unobtrusive. Kudos to Optus for this, they used to really suck.\nWiFi\u2026 I read that some people find wifi lousy on this phone. Totally fine and quick for me, perhaps because my previous phone was so old anything would look better.\nBluetooth audio \u2013 seems totally fine. For me, this pretty much just means Spotify. Works fine so far.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve done to get it working and looking the way I want:\nFirst, fixed ads. Man it is incredible how much ads ruin the internet. I don\u2019t know how anyone can stand using a mobile device without ad-blocking. DO THIS. \nhttps://forum.xda-developers.com/mat...-spam-t3740126\r\n nb Spotify and FB Messenger don\u2019t work properly with the hosts file in that thread; I had to grab a different hosts file.\nInstalled an OLD version of ES File Explorer and blocked updating on it. I need to have a useable file system just as a matter of principle.\nInstalled chrome beta and disabled notifications from it, so I stop getting that \u201cclose all incognito tabs\u201d notification. No, it\u2019s not porn\u2026 incognito\u2019s the only way I know to stop some news sites I read from counting how many articles I\u2019ve viewed that month and then hitting me with a \u201cpay up\u201d overlay.\nChopped up my micro sim card so I could get a mobile connection (thanks for supplying one Optus).\nAfter some playing around with EMUI, I am using Nova Launcher instead. I couldn\u2019t get EMUI to look the way I wanted it to \u2013 it\u2019s not so much functionality as being able to customise. I have the desktop grid set to 10x6 and the app draw to 11x7, which for me looks spot on at 500dpi. Using Nova means the EMUI widgets, eg weather widget, don\u2019t work. I am using Chronus for these widgets. I already had the paid versions of both Nova and Chronus.\nSwitch on the navigation dock and hide the navbar\nEnabled developer options and set DPI to 500.\n\n\nSome things to be aware of (culled out of various threads):Huawei uses fairly aggressive battery management which shuts down apps you do in fact want to keep running such as Virtual Hosts (for ad blocking - see above), and anything that runs a widget that should keep updating.\n\r\nTo keep an app running you have to (I think!) change settings in both \u201cApps\u201d and \u201cspecial access\u201d, that is:Settings \u2013 Apps & Notifications \u2013 Apps \u2013 [name of the app] \u2013 Battery \u2013 Launch, then set to \u201cmanage manually\u201d and turn on auto launch, secondary launch, and run in background.\nUnder \u201cspecial access\u201d (no idea how to get there, I just search settings), allow \u201cignore battery optimisation\u201d.\n\n\nThings I still want to sort out (I will try to edit this post when I find solutions):Media volume through the speakers and headphones is a bit quiet. Bluetooth audio is fine though. Not that critical and for me, a problem with just about every device out there. Time for a Bluetooth headset?\nThe phone comes with Swiftkey installed. I am not sure yet but it feels like swiftkey freezes briefly every now and again. I will play around with keyboards to check.\nMake the change to DPI persistent. Maybe this can be done with ADB? I have not tried yet.\nIt would be great if the fingerprint scanner could be given more uses. For example it would make a great \u201chome\u201d button. It can be made to work by sliding to show the notification panel or to browse photos. That\u2019s cool, probably not what I would have picked for functions though.\nNo sound on some videos through speakers, but sound through headphones. Clearly a software problem.\n\r\nAt this stage I am not rooting. I will at least wait until I\u2019m satisfied I don\u2019t have any hardware issues requiring warranty. It doesn\u2019t look like there is anything I need to root for now though. \n\nOverall:\n\r\nOverall I am really, really happy with this phone. I tried to make myself want a Galaxy S9 or a Note 8, but I just can't take to the look of them. The Mate 10 Pro is very, very close to ticking all my boxes. It doesn't trip any deal-breakers for me and I am really picky about getting things to work the way I'd like them to. I would like to be able to customise a little more and if I could have root and xposed etc without blowing my warranty I would, but there would only be minimal reason to do this.", "time": "30th March 2018, 07:45 PM", "postID": "post76070783", "replies": []}, {"text": "Overall i love my huawei mate 10 pro im very satisfied overall in performance battery life, and so on!
