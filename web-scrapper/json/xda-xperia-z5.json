Quick Charge 3.0 is not supported on this device.. And to be honest, you don't even need it.. \"Why is that??\" you may ask.. Here is the simple answer..\nUsing a 5v 2.1A USB Charging Adapter and a thick USB charging cable with a length of about 60cm (MAX) (shorter the better). Will charge your device fast enough... Believe me.. lol\n\n2. Atleast once a week (Full charge your battery from a depleted state) - Dead battery, and while it is powered off.. Dont start charging it for only a few minutes and then turning it on.. LEAVE IT OFF (if you dont have any alarms set for the next morning etc)\n\n3. Do NOT keep your device on charge while you're playing  CPU and GPU intensive games.. IF your battery is at roughly 70% or Above.. UNPLUG the charger from your phone.. Or you will shorten the life span of your battery very quickly.. Because at 70% and Above charging speed slows down significantly to the point where if you're playing games your battery will keep discharging rather than charge because it's consuming more power than it can restore..\n(Hence the damage to overall battery life span).\n\n4. Last but not least.. Every so often.. If you're a power user (someone who always plays a shi*t load of games and has heaps of apps running in the background etc etc). Try to remember to Calibrate your battery every so often..\n(Usually when you notice things like -----> Battery draining unusually faster than normal, Battery not holding charge as long as it use to, device heating up a little more than normal, charging isn't as fast or efficient anymore) etc..\n\nJust a few things i thought i'd throw out there.. \n\ntake care Ya'll..", "time": "1st August 2016, 06:00 AM", "postID": "post67990352", "replies": []}, {"text": "I'm using a third party Quick charger and the result is attached and from 8% to 100% in 1 hour and 56 minutes.\nhttp://www.aliexpress.com/item/Ugree...1-7594ef5aaff9\r\n Is the charging speed fine as quick charge like 9V-2A or its equal to 5V-2A?\r\nAnd\r\nCould someone tell me the charging time and speed who are using the Sony Quick charge UCH10", "time": "15th August 2016, 08:12 PM", "postID": "post68202637", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "Screen on time", "rating": 3.5, "links": ["https://forum.xda-developers.com/xperia-z5/review/screen-time-t3348513", "https://forum.xda-developers.com/xperia-z5/review/screen-time-t3348513/page2", "https://forum.xda-developers.com/xperia-z5/review/screen-time-t3348513/page3", "https://forum.xda-developers.com/xperia-z5/review/screen-time-t3348513/page5"], "threads": [{"text": "The best SOT Android smartphone ever, this was confirmed by a lot users and famous blogs.", "time": "31st March 2016, 05:37 PM", "postID": "post66130324", "replies": []}, {"text": "Best for me is 4:48 as reported by Battery Monitor Widget, but mostly is 3D games so I think is pretty good", "time": "5th April 2016, 12:45 AM", "postID": "post66198343", "replies": []}, {"text": "I have my Phone 3 hours off Power, Battery goes down to 60% and the main app draining power is the Display with 17% as per the battery consumption chart. \nIn the Details to the batteryconsumption of the display it says the display was on for 1:35, however I hardly turned it on.\nThat is the same since LP and even with MM I reset already 3 times. no change.\nI would love the meet someone with that great performance. mine seems just broken :/", "time": "6th April 2016, 12:27 PM", "postID": "post66221339", "replies": []}, {"text": "Such a pity that the battery is not awesome maybe due to bloatwares", "time": "10th April 2016, 04:01 PM", "postID": "post66290138", "replies": [{"text": "Actually I hope so.
