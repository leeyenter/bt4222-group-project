I like getting a new phone every two years, and when I upgrade, it has to be a real upgrade! I was coming from a HTC One Max, so the new phone had to have the following:\n\n1. Same sized screen, or very close. When you get a 50 inch TV, you do not want to go back to a 20!  \n2. The internal storage had to be more. I went from 32 to 64GB. \n3. My phones HAVE to have an SD card slot for storage expansion. I use Google Drive, but access to it is too slow, and it uses data transferring or adding files to it if I am off wifi.\n4. The V10 has a replaceable battery, which was the only thing I did not like about the One Max. I have never had a battery go bad in a phone, but do not want to have to swap out the entire device and be without a phone while it is being repaired or replaced. I can now also buy a high capacity battery if I want.\n5. Did not think it was possible, but the screen on the V10 is better than the Max.\n6. The processor is faster.

I believe I saw somewhere the the color (Kelvin) is well north of 5000, which supports this notion.  That said, to me it's hardly noticeable.  THe second is the brightness. I kept the N6 at about 33% percent brightness and I keep the v10 at 45% brightness to achieve the same appearance.  Again, this is a minor issue, except for the battery impact.   I'm on my third charge cycle, and after 36 hours of run time on this charge and nearly 3 hours of talk time and 2 hours of screen on time, I'm at 8 %.
