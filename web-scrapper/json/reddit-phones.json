However, incompatibility with stuff has begun to persuade me that I need something new. I've even conceded that I'm going to have to deal with a touch screen, despite how stupid they are as a concept. However, I don't want a phone that's a downgrade in terms of any of the things that the C1-01 does. In particular: \n\n1. Battery life: If it doesn't last at least several days of light usage, it's useless to me.  \n2. Size: I don't want one of these ridiculous great slabs everybody seems to be selling these days. Going down to C1-01 size seems to not be an option, but I'd like something as small as possible. No more than say 10cm or so along the long axis. Something I can actually conveniently carry around.  \n3. Replacable battery: that some phones don't have this seems utterly insane to me. It should be obvious from the above that I'm expecting this phone to last rather a lot longer than most people do, so not being able to swap out the battery when it inevitably runs down is not an option.  \n\nNow, there are some features I am after: \n\n1. Must be able to act as a wi-fi hotspot.  \n2. Must have Bluetooth 4.0 and Android 4.4 or later (required to resolve the above-mentioned compatibility issues) [or iOS 9 or later, but it doesn't look like any iOS devices satisfy the above).  \n3. In case there are any options that satisfy the above but don't have it, It'll need to have GPS as well. \n4. I'm in the UK, so it should be available here at a reasonable price and function properly on all UK networks.  \n\nAnd some features I explicitly *don't* care about, or actively don't want, despite their apparent popularity:  \n\n1. Fingerprint sensors are silly.  \n2. Bullshit toughness/water resistance claims: Unless you're giving me actual figures in line with Caterpillar's phones, I don't trust your claims anyway, so it's going in a case the day it comes and never coming out again, so I don't care. If it is really strong and independently tested to an actual standard sufficient that I don't need to buy a case to take it up a mountain in a storm, then that's a significant plus that I'd be willing to pay extra for (because it would make it smaller by not needing the case).  \n3. Resolution: It's probably never going to display anything fancy, so I couldn't care less what the resolution is.  \n4. Camera: If I want to take photos, I'll use a damned camera with a real lens on, not a shitty little one crammed into a phone.  \n\n\nThere's no particular budget I've got in mind, but given my requirements, I don't expect it'll be a fortune.

The speed of this phone is ridiculous especially at low percentage (which is all the time now since the battery goes down so fast).

I do about a 15 minute walk to the store (only listening to music), and check my phone has 42%. I thought that will be fine i will be quick, i was sure enough and pull out my phone and still at 42% starts going at snail pace, like super slow. I wanted open the app i use to make payments then it starts to reboot. I explained to the teller phone is having trouble, nice lady waits while i wait for the phone to reboot. I powers one now at 37% and i start trying open the app. I had to scan a qr code i scan it and does nothing, just loads, it loads for a like full minute and reboots again. (The lady starts serving other people while waiting for me (its a small family owned store)). It takes forever to power on with way less battery (distinctly remember the battery icon was red i think 19% but not sure).

Today I got a brand new Asus Zenfone Max Plus and I'm wondering whether to switch phones or sell it. \n\nMy concerns: \nMy iPhone 6s 64GB works fine but it has a giant crack on both the screen as well as the back camera (right through the middle, so in pictures it shows up blur or as a lens flare unless the lighting is just right). To change the screen alone would cost around $205. My GPS also doesn't work very well. I've lived with it for a few months and it only sometimes annoys me, but is otherwise fine. My main annoyance is the back camera, but I have a husband with a Samsung S8+ so I just use his phone to take pictures and send it to myself.\n\nSocially, most of my colleagues use iPhones as well and it's seen as the status quo. (Two of them just upgraded to iPhone X last week.)\n\nI also rely on iMessage especially with a very close friend from another country who isn't on social media like Facebook/Whatsapp so iMessage is our go-to. I really don't want to lose contact and I'm not sure how easy it'll be to continue our communication if I don't have iMessage on my phone. (I'll be able to use iMessage on laptop only...)\n\nSince my laptop is a Mac, I really enjoy the synchronisation across the platforms- AirDrop is especially convenient for me since I do social media editing heavily. However my MBP is also 5 years old, and it is possible that I may be changing to new laptop (most likely non-Mac because budget, although again i do deal heavily with designing software like Adobe Photoshop, Premiere Pro etc and personally I still like Macs) to keep up with the times. My laptop is already showing signs of strain but ONLY when I play Overwatch on Windows partition, while on my Mac partition I can use both Ps and Pr concurrently with no issue. Long story short, while my laptop is working fine right now, I am still worried that it may go kaput simply due to its age. If it does, and I switch to a Windows machine, I have less reason to upgrade to an iPhone.\n\nThe Asus Zenfone Max Plus is brand new in box and retail price is $230 or so (which is only a little more than the cost of the screen replacement). Reviews are generally positive and apparently it has fancy things like dual camera. I don't know how well these things work (not a specs person). If I sell it, I'd probably be able to fetch $200 or so which isn't much. While I do enjoy the customizability of themes and stuff that Android provides, that's about it. I suppose I will eventually switch to Android because iPhones are getting ridic expensive though.\n\nTLDR:\n- Currently on iPhone (cracked screen and lens) &amp; MacBook Pro\n- Enjoys the easy sync, AirDrop, and iMessage\n- MBP is 5 years old, worried it is on its last legs\n- Personally would prefer Mac products but hard to afford\n- Asus Zenfone Max can only fetch $200ish if sold \n\nQuestion: To maintain iPhone &amp; MBP combo or to switch to Android? Should I just sell the Asus and save up? Should I embrace the Windows/Android life? If I do switch, what can I do to make the Apple-to-Android transition less jarring?\n\nAll suggestions and comments are more than welcome!!!

I suffer from obsessive compulsive disorder so severe that it completely disables me. I must throw everything I touch away every two weeks. It is not feasible to dispose of SIM cards (or handsets) this often. I use a computer with only a cheap mouse (which I replace fortnightly). I NEED an unchanging mobile number so that I can be regularly contacted by a multitude of health professionals.\n\nUp until now, I have relied on an app called \"Tugo\" made by the UK provider \"o2\" which allows you to make and receive calls over wifi straight from your browser **using your o2 mobile number.** Call and text history and even voicemail is stored in the cloud. This app was designed for people with poor network coverage or as a stop-gap for when their phone was lost, forgotten or out of battery, however it was life changing for me. It meant that I could maintain a phone contract whilst never even touching the SIM or any handset. It was perfect. o2 are closing Tugo down today.\n\nOn top of losing my entire conversation history which contains vital information about my treatment and support, I am devastated as I now can't even do things which require text authentication (like internet banking or Steamguard) Basically, I'm fucked.\n\n* A Skype number is no good as it is not a mobile number and Skype won't let me call emergency numbers.\n* Google Voice is not an option seeing as their number porting service is only available to US users.\n* Buying a phone and somehow attaching peripherals (monitor,  disposable mouse) is not a good option because I would only be able to make and receive calls and texts whilst at my desk, with Tugo I could do so away from home as long as friends/ support workers could log on for me on their devices.\n\nI am desperately searching for a solution either along the lines of a **virtual** SIM or mobile number, or some sort of way to connect a SIM card to a desktop and have it make and receive calls using the GSM network and the desktop's speakers and mic.\n\nI have found many apps that *almost* do what I need but they are only available on andriod and IOS and not for desktop. I'm unsure if running an android emulator would help because many of them require you to at least have your SIM inserted into a smartphone at the point of account creation to \"link\" it up. I would maybe be able to buy a smartphone to throw away as a one off as long as I was sure the app would do what I need thereafter, after all, I am willing to pay well for any service that would help me to retain control of my life in some way.\n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated, thanks.", "created": 1512080028.0, "replies": []}, "7gp9se": {"title": "Looking for a good android phone in the region of about 150-300 pounds", "text": "So I accidentally destroyed my Nokia 5 and was looking for a good android in the range of 150-300, specs aren't incredibly important and I would probably sacrifice a nice design for a bit less power.

This means you should charge your iPhone to 100% and let it fully discharge until it turns off by itself.
