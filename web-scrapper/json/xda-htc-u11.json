Overall, this phone is a 7 out of 10 at best.  I am on T-Mobile and not happy.  I have been with HTC since 2009.  And was always impressed.  The last phone was the HTC One.  This U11+ is simply unreliable.  \nCalls: When I call people they are frequently unable to hear me on the first call.  Maybe they do hear me on the second call.  We do hear each other if they call me back.  \nGmail: Frequently, the gmail app does not load properly. It will give me a white screen.  I go out, and come back in, and we are fine.\nBattery: It lasts about 30 hours.  But I am not a heavy user, and do try to keep location turned off. \nSpeaker: Sometimes caller does not hear me via speaker phone.  \n\nT-Mo tech support said that this phone does not have LTE 1900.  Therefore I am operating on 4G 1900.  That is not T Mo's sweet spot.\n\nDid I complain enough?  I can give you a fresh one.

I do like it a lot. I'm coming from the HTC 10 which I really loved but in the end the battery wasn't up to scratch anymore.\nThe U11+ is large, almost too large for my jeans pockets but that's not surprising, the phone dimensions were no secret. I got the hyped transparent black version and I like it but I think it's far overrated. Thanks to that ultra glossy glass back it's impossible to use the phone without a case, I'm using a cheap transparent flexible bumper thing which does the job.\nThe battery life is great, it easily does 48 hrs (without any optimisation other that disabling News Republic) and more (actually more than 72hrs over Christmas when I hadn't used it much) with the same usage pattern of my old 10 which lasted about 10 hrs in the end and one full day when it was new so this is surely a great improvement. The screen of the 10 is the better one I woould say, especially that purple tint when scrolling doesn't look nice, but it's sharp, bright and the colours are good.\nI haven't taken many photos but the few I took were at least as good as the already very good 10's camera. The earphones are amazing and so is the fingerprint scanner.\n\nI won't say that I love it but as mentioned before, I like it a lot. I'm still happy that I haven't bought the 5T instead out of impatience!

I think people out there who diminished the problem is because they are not used to good screens or they are blind, and moreover, when they tell you \"I look the phone straight forward\", is bull5sh1t as well, because I faced plenty of situations when I couldn't see the phone straight forward and it was annoying.\n\r\nPeople can say you can have the best camera, the best software updates, unlimited space for photos and videos, no lag, etc, but let me tell you that all of those \"selling points\" for the Pixel are not that good:Best camera - Honestly, I made a photo comparison between the U11+ and the Pixel 2 XL, and in 7 of 10, the HTC was better and with more detail, text was more legible and forms were sharper. I think that HTC learned something after making every Pixel so far, but when I show the pictures, people just blame me and say I'm crazy. Video on Pixel was horrible and the audio extremely poor. The difference in aperture indeed makes a difference, even when it seems a small one.\nSoftware updates - Yes, you have them, but guess what?, it breaks compatibility sometimes with apps. With the Pixel 2 XL I had a lot of force close applications, so what's the point of having the latest release if Google is not obligating developers to update their applications timely?. Yes, 3 years of software updates, but honestly, who stays with the phone for 3 years?.\nPhotos and video - I don't use Google or any other storage service to have all my photos and videos. I'm old school, and I put everything is a hard drive. I think is safer, besides, I don't like that certain things of my private life are around in the internet.\n\r\nBut the screen is not the only issue, I faced a lot of other hardware and software issues along the way, and thanks to the extremely bad quality control from LG and Google, the device you are getting is overall mediocre quality. I was expecting to receive a device with no serious bugs and well built because it a phone directly from Google, but the reality is totally another one.\n\r\nOverall, I faced the following issues that made me return this phone:\r\nBlue tint\r\nSlow fingerprint sensor\r\nSuper slow \"fast\" charge (taking no less than 3 hours)\r\nBluetooth issues while streaming music\r\nProblems with Android Auto\r\nBanding while recording video\r\nAwful sound and video quality\n\r\nComing from the Mate 9 Pro, one of the finest devices I have ever had, was a big hit for me to change to the Pixel 2 XL because all of these issues. Each time I saw the screen, it just made me sad and made me wonder: why a \u20ac1K phone have these kind of issues?, and moreover, what kind of idiot am I to buy and accept something like this with all these flaws?. Google is not getting my money this year, and believe me when I say that I'm a Google fan, but quality and product overall is not in pair with what most flagships are offering.\n\r\nStill I see why people is buying and defending the Pixel, and in the moment I was packing it to return it, I felt bad, like if I was betraying Google or the ideology. At some moment I felt fear to return it and better keep it and accept the flaws, but that makes me no different from all the iSheeps you see out there that buy everything that comes with an Apple logo in the back, something that I clearly hate, because we are becoming zombies instead of intelligent consumers.\n\r\nI have the U11+ for a week now and I can say I feel home again, is like having my old Mate 9 Pro, but with Android stock, and I haven't faced any issues AT ALL, just perfect, smooth and awesome behaviour. I can highly recommend the device.\n\n\n\r\nP.D.: Sorry for the long post.", "time": "25th January 2018, 08:51 AM", "postID": "post75325704", "replies": []}]}]}, {"text": "I have been using the U11+ since December 21st and I love it.
