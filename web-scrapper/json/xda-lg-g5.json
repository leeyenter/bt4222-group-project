I'm a bit old school and prefer simple flip phones. We would probably still be using Samsung Rugby flip phones if they worked with our carrier. \n\nIf you're in the market for a high end phone that's more than shiny, with lots of usable practical features and actually includes the latest available technology, consider the LG G5. We think it definitely has more hits than misses.\n\n1. The 3 Cameras, make the phone one of the best camera substitute\n2. Modern CPU (Qualcomm 820, currently top of the line) helps performance, battery efficiency, spectrum / wireless performance.\n3. 4GB RAM useful for multitasking and running large demanding software\n4. 32GB internal built in storage\n5. Expandable storage with Micro SD (sorry Apple)\n6. Miracast, industry standard screen sharing\n7. IR Blaster\n8. USB-C, the modern USB port the industry actually agrees and moving towards\n(including devices from Apple, Google, Microsoft, LG, etc).\n9. User removable / replaceable battery\n10. Modular, and easy repair-ability\n11. FM capable - enabled depending on carrier\n12. A major phone brand / model thus more available accessories\n13. Price point - best value for high end / flagship phone\n\nCons - what's missing that other devices may offer\n1. Water / Dust proof - a nicety, and can be added to the LG G5 via certain cases.\n2. Premium Metal / Glass feel - subjective. The LG G5 is all aluminum but covered in a primer paint. Besides, most folks I know use a phone case.\n\nWe have a number of mobile lines / phones within our family. Our last few phones have been Samsung, from Samsung flip phones to Android devices Galaxy T989D/S2X, Note 2, Note 3, Note 4. When we were up for replacements, we going to go with Samsung Galaxy Note 4, but it was no longer available, replaced by the Note 5. The Note 5 was more expensive than the Note 4. It was hard to justify paying more for a successor that included less than its predecessor - no Micro SD, no IR, no removable battery. Note 5 excluded usable practical features for a shiny exterior, and wasn't even water proof. We heard new phones were coming March / April 2016 so we waited and eventually decided on the LG G5.  We believe it to be the best value, and offered the opportunity to award a vendor trying to innovate.\n\nUltimately it's just a phone, but at least it has the more important convergence features covered, mainly solid phone features, and solid camera.\n\n** Unrelated, but its thanks to XDA community and other enthusiasts who help keep golden oldies such as the T989/S2X and Note 2 phones kicking.

I have no problem walking to work and using my phone while wearing sunglasses! I could never do that with my Nexus 6. This is my first phone with a fingerprint scanner and I am really impressed at how responsive it is.

Not a big deal, but odd I think. I can't wait until we get some custom ROMs for this device so I can flash a stock/non-carrier branded image to this device and get rid of all that crap bloatware!

The second camera is a gimmick that is useless in daily operation.\n- The overall design is boring.\n- The haptics of the phone doesn't matter because I have to use a TPU cover to keep the curved glass on the top from chipping again on slightest impact.\n- The stock LG apps (Music, contacts, launcher, camera, etc.) don't even play in the same ballpark as the ones from Google or Sony (the predecessor was a Xperia Z2)\n- The update frequency is not what I expected from a flagship phone.

Learn patience as well as solidarity  toward developers and end users. Respect each other and stop the bad mouthing or in this case bad words. Inknow this device can get better if developers manage to finish the cm development for it, and after that many other roms based on cm. But i dont blame them if they get stuck at some point.  In fact, it is awesome that they managed to get root for h830 and h850,  even if many said that for the h830 the root wouldn't  be able to be achieved.  And for the h850 which showed a more free path to achieve root.  If you want to blame someone,  blame the carriers you are currently using.  Also,  i havent seen any Cm development  on the s7 or s7 edge,  yes, they have made some stock roms but it isnt cm based.  So.... Dont say that other phones  have gone ahead of this one if they havent done a cm based rom.  Because stock rom is based on stock.  And why would we want to use a stock rom if the interface and almost everything  remains the same?  Then for that it is better to make a patch and not a rom.  Unless it is like alliancerom which has a lot of customatization even if is stock.  So, please calm down.  Lets act as people and not as something which i dont even have a name for.  If you are tired  of waiting for cm development,  then change your device for one more to your liking.  No one is forcing you to keep  that device. And if developments  seems to move at a faster pace than for instance the galaxy s7 after some time,  then just change the device again. \n\nAfter all not everybody has the same level of patience so,  why not change the phone?  Im currently talking from a samsung galaxy s5 which i want to change because  of the amoled screen and also some other things i hate. However,  im waiting very patiently for lg g5 cm development,  even if my galaxy s5 gps is not working,  my amoled screen has burn in image,  my screen kind of flickers if i press a little harder and wont turn on until i press really hard.  And the s5 keeps devaluing for everyday.

I like stock roms but stock roms cannot be customized as much as on CM. And it is not that i like CM, I like roms based on CM. Roms like AICP, RR, Blisspop. I know speed is not an issue with this phone, it hardly could be. However, because speed is not an issue anymore since they have created phones with 3Gb of ram and up , and the processor of Snapdragon 820 now, well, it make sense to prioritize other things now such as looking, functionalities, etc... if someone were to create a rom such as Alliancerom for LG G5 i would definitely stick to stock rom, and probably have a 2nd rom installed in the same External sd card. ( that of course if dual boot is achieved). But i doubt that someone will create a rom such as alliancerom since it is mostly TW based with Samsung as main device.  So, to be honest i dont like the UI or how the settings looks like on the LG G5. A rom highly customizable such as Alliancerom allows to change almost everything including the looking of the settings. But, at least with CM and the themes, personification can vary. and sometimes there are extra functionalities that otherwise you wouldnt find in stock roms.", "time": "5th June 2016, 07:36 AM", "postID": "post67176552", "replies": [{"text": "Fair enough", "time": "5th June 2016, 07:38 AM", "postID": "post67176570", "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"text": "So I'm leaving for 3 weeks,  are there any various tests that i can run? \n\n\n\n---------- Post added at 06:55 PM ---------- Previous post was at 06:49 PM ----------\n\nLike I'll have intermittent Internet, more so wondering if there are any adb or the likewise", "time": "5th June 2016, 07:55 PM", "postID": "post67184875", "replies": [{"text": "with test are you refering to roms, root, mods and such thing?

Immediately upgraded to the latest Android 7 security patch\n    Transferred my apps and settings over from my LG G4 to the G5 using LG Backup to wirelessly transfer between the 2 phones\n    After G5 was set up the battery life (in Doze while not using the phone) was great. It might drop 2 \u2013 3% overnight on Wi-Fi\n    After a few days the battery would drop between 5-12% per hour while in doze. There were no rogue apps running in the background. The main culprit was Android OS and Phone Idle\u2026\n    Rooted the phone and tried every battery saving setting I could find and used Greenify and CPU throttling as well. This resulted in no improvement.\n    I had a second RS988 I could test (long story). Followed the same steps as listed in 1-4 but again after a day or so the battery life would crap out.\n    Took the rooted phone and downgraded to Android 6. Reinstalled each app from the Google Play Store (did not use the LG backup as in #3 above). Made recommended battery settings changes in the Android OS and installed Greenify. Did not make any other changes (e.g. CPU throttling)\n    Now after 2 weeks overnight my battery drops between 1 \u2013 3 % per night.
