Optional read.\n\nI'm located in the USA and use a smaller service provider called The People's Operator. It primarily uses the T-Mobile network.\nI use my phone quite a bit and would need something with decent to high-end specs. At least 3GB RAM, 32GB internal storage and SD card support is a must. \n  \nI've been through a bunch of phones recently trying to find one that is a good fit for me without any glaring flaws. I've tried the LG G5, Moto X 2014, and Moto X pure.  \nThe LG was a solid phone with awesome features rarely found these days, such as an IR blaster (love this) and an easily swappable battery... but definitely has a larger display than I'd prefer.  \nThe Moto X 2014 has a bit more compact size, but the lack of SD card access is a deal breaker.  \n  \nThe Moto X Pure that I'm currently using is a good phone, but the screen is much larger than I'd prefer. Another strike against it is that the battery life is just awful. If it had a swappable battery this would be less of a concern, but nope. It has also been a little glitchy from time to time.  \nI absolutely love the Moto features, particularly the ingeniously elegant and wave/approach display lock screen. Being able to check the time and notifications with a wave over the screen or a slight nudge is one of my favorite phone features of all time. I've tried several apps that somewhat replicate this feature, but none have come close to properly executing on it.  \nI'm taking a hard look at the Moto G5 Plus 64GB, though it is still on the larger side within tolerance with a 5.2\" screen.\nAlso interesting is the Pixel 1, with a nice 5.0\" screen. I'm doing some research on this now and there seems to be some mixed reviews. Also I think it would lack some of those Moto features I love without proper equivalent replacement features.  \nSo yeah. I'm leaning toward the Moto G5 at this point, but I just want to be done with this searching and sampling and rebuilding my home screens and whatnot. It's taking up more time than it's worth.  \nSince I use my phone a lot I figure it is worth the investment to do a lot of research, but I'm reaching the overdone threshold.  \nAny thoughts?", "created": 1511652960.0, "replies": []}, "7fh8uf": {"title": "Upgrading from iPhone 6", "text": "I have been using iPhone 6 for quite sometime and I would like to make the switch to Android now.

All I'm going to need from this phone is the ability to play music. My current phone is an \"LGMS323\" it's got like 3 gigs of memory and any external memory card above like 16 is incompatible. I bought a new memory card to put in but you can't freely access it without downloading an app and can't have things automatically be saved to it, you have to transfer everything manually making it completely useless unless I do everything from my computer. Also the camera is crap. I've never cared about phones before this point. Growing up people were always running around with the next new $700+ phone every 3 weeks, using Snaper and Digimon Battle and all that. Then you've got me, had a flip phone / brick phone for the majority of my life and has this LGMS323 for who knows how long. It was too weak and out of date to do any of these fancy phone apps so I missed the boat on all that. All I want to be able to do is put a bunch of music on it so that I can just strap it to my arm when I go for runs and other exercises. If the camera is good then I can take some nice scenic shots.  \n\nI don't need any of these pointless bells and whistles that seem to be standard now a days like \"finger print recognition\" and \"heart rate sensors\" or any of that. A simple number lock is good enough for me and I don't need to know what my heart rate is, I can do it manually if I need to know. \n\nI never text but I like to have the option to with unlimited texting.

I hate that thing.\n\n3- How reliable are the Google Apps on an iPhone? I use almost all google apps, from GMail, Youtube, Maps, Photos and all, are those reliable on iOS? I mean proper push notifications for GMail, accuracy on Google Maps and all, there?\n\n4- Is there a way to hide all apps from homescreen and push them to an app drawer or something? I don't like the wallpaper to be all covered up with some damned icons.\n\n5- I have checked the technical measurements and all on GSMA, and its pretty average, but how is the call quality on them iPhones? I am looking at the 6S specifically, probably might even go for 7 if I feel right, but no 3.5 mm is utterly stupid, so might skip that.\n\n6- Does Apple intentionally push updates which creep down an older version of iPhone and only keep the latest iteration smooth?

I'm looking for a smartphone that will travel internationally but that I can then use when I bring back to the states (if theres something that would work with tmobil back in the states that would be great!). I'll probably try to buy the phone in bangkok when I get there in two weeks as i'm currently in southern india. i'd like something with a decent camera (currently have an iphone 5s) but beyond that I just use basic apps (maps, tinder, news, whatever). Would probably like to spend under $300 but I tend to throw my phones in a destruction-proof case and keep them for a long time so I want something good. thanks!\n\n", "created": 1485605808.0, "replies": [{"text": "Nexus 5X, or even the 6P if you can get it at a good price.

(edit: or on the flip side, if this becomes his primary phone, i think he would want to go with sprint, then? something about the brand name that seems like it'll work better? so we would like the option to transfer to sprint from a prepaid if needed) he would like to keep with sprint, we have been using sprint for years now (with work) and have always had good service. \n\nis it better to buy a phone online/somewhere else (ie. not at a sprint store) or is it better to get the \"deals\" that sprint would give us if we buy a phone with them? \n\nany insight would be appreciated! thanks!", "created": 1521386333.0, "replies": [{"text": "I would check out the nocontract subreddit.
