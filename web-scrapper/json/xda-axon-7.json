I downloaded and examined the photos on the TechRadar review (lowlight, specifically). Between the GS7E, Axon 7, and the iP6S+, on the photo of the guy playing the claw game, if this is an example of the Axon 7's so-called poor lowlight then I have nothing to worry about when this phone arrives. \n\nThe iPhone does the best in noise control and preserves good detail, but the picture is too dark. The Galaxy is the purported lowlight king, and produces the brightest picture with the most pleasing colors, but the corner noise is higher than the iPhone (and arguably the Axon as well) and there are obvious signs of oversharpening and heavy post-processing (look at the area around the \"Barnes and Noble\" on the wall). The Axon blows out some highlights, and has a less pleasing color balance than the Galaxy...both are better than the iPhone. \n\nWithout pixel peeping, I like the Axon and the Galaxy photos better than the iPhone for everything. The Galaxy wins I think because of the obvious things like color balance and brightness and control of dynamic range, whereas I have to give the Axon the win for overall texture. That's without pixel peeping. The smoother gradients and less noise look good on the Axon. \n\nI wonder how much better the Axon would be with slightly less noise reduction?

The car (which I believe is the subject of the picture) is rendered the best on the Axon, whereas overall the Galaxy does the best rendering the entire picture. Brightness is good here, but I like the iPhone's color balance the best.\n\r\nThis is perhaps the most shocking of the day photos, and you'll see why. Take the bridge photo with the walkway and the people. If you look at the beams over the cars, there are posters/stickers on them. The iPhone is the worst, but even the Galaxy can't touch the Axon in how it actual renders readable text. The pole between the walkway and the beams is another example. The iPhone and the Galaxy show blurriness on it, while you can make out the words and graffiti on the pole in the Axon. Finally, the people on the walkway are more detailed on the Axon at a distance. If you use the people standing near the trash can/bench in the distance, the Axon clearly renders the most detail on faces and bodies.\n\r\nOverall, the Galaxy produces the most consistent pictures with the best overall balance. But this defeat when it comes to detail by a $400 phone comes as a testament to the disadvantages that come with a lower megapixel count and having every pixel split into two (dual pixel tech)...faster focus and brighter pictures (due to aperture?), but you lose a lot of potential detail.", "time": "14th August 2016, 04:20 PM", "postID": "post68184816", "replies": []}, {"text": "Someone try Snap Camera on play store please.\nUsually see big improvements with this app.", "time": "22nd August 2016, 08:52 AM", "postID": "post68302730", "replies": []}, {"text": "I found stock camera app will usually prefer to underexpose and preserve detail rather than brighten up excessively and blow highlights.\nSnap is good.\nHaven't tried open camera on the A7 as I usually find it has issues with the screen preview not matching the recorded result in regards to the captured area.

So, even though you have a stronger band 12 signal available, the network will often push you to band 2 or 4 if it can do so as these frequencies yield better throughput in general and will free up spectrum on band 12, which is usually a bit more scarce (low band airwaves are typically more congested, so higher band airwaves like band 2 and 4 are preferred for network management purposes).\n\r\nThe only way to limit your phone to band 12 that I know of is hack into the non-volatile memory via the diagnostic mode and QXDM and manually enable/disable LTE bands 2 and/or 4...but that's probably more trouble than it's worth, especially if you don't want to permanently remove these bands. Plus, diagnostic mode can be super hard to get into on some devices and there are some protections which make it hard to make changes stick permanently, depending on the device.\n\r\nAlso, I should mention that Verizon and AT&T do the exact same thing as T-Mobile in my experience - for instance, band 13 for Verizon seems to only be used when band 4 or 2 are super low strength or completely unavailable.

It was so unbelievable that ZTE could release phone with such problem. Anyway I ordered it from Amazon and I got it yesterday. (A2017G/B03)\n\nOf course I would have liked to check it immediately.  Recently we have used Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and S4. Actually we are satisfied with both phones very much so far. We haven't had any signal or Wi-Fi issue for years. So I compared A7 to them. We were in a place where gsm/3G/4G signal strength was very poor. Practically it meant zero inside the building and very poor in outside. My first experience was that I got signal inside sometimes with A7 but apart from this gsm and data capability was the same around the house. It is poor of course. \n\nLater at home I did some measurement by using Network Signal Info. I put phones next to each other. Both got SIM from same provider (Vodafone) and they connected to same tower (LTE). Signal strength was between 70 and 80 dBm during the test and from time to time I exchanged phones in position. I did test horizontal position as well as vertical position. Well I would say that A7 and Note 3 performed on very same level. May be Axon was better with 1 or 2 and rarely 3 dB more times than vice-verse but it was hard to diagnose. Also the position was very important. Phone which was in a particular position performed better almost always. I repeat the test with S4 too. May be it is better than other two but I have to emphasize that differences were very-very tiny. Rather I would say that 3 phones have same signal receiver capability. \n\nWi-fi. I can say same. ZTE has same signal strength and data transfer rate as Note 3 but I have to emphasize here as well that many-many things can impact the result included the position of the tester near to the phones. \nI copied files from to PC via Wi-fi and Total Commander showed same rate as in case of Note and S4 earlier.\n Finally. My opinion is that ZTE is not worse than the average at all. What is more it performs very well even if some phones are better.
