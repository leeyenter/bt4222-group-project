If I'm being honest, I find it a touch slippy in the hand and I'm quite worried about dropping the damn thing, but I'm hoping a case will make this better...once it arrives!\nPerformance: Excellent. Zero lag, zero slow down.\nBattery: Coming from the Nexus 5, it's really good. This was actually my primary reason for buying this over the Nexus 5x - bigger phone == more room for battery, and so far this shows. Today has been a light-use day, to be fair, but still sat at 76% at 8pm is just awesome. My Nexus 5 wouldn't do that well even if I didn't use it all day...in flight mode...switched off. Exceptionally happy here.\nStability: Have had the phone for 7 days, uptime: 7 days. Nuff said.\nCamera: Too early to say, but I don't think it's quite as great as everyone says it is. There's still no way in the app to do manual control (e.g. shutter priority for capturing pictures of fast moving objects) so the results still look, well, like they've been taken with a phone. That's not to say it's bad - it's certainly better than the Nexus 5, which was leagues better than the Nexus 4 - it's just...average. Give us some manual control, Google! Lens Blur still takes great shots and it's very responsive, so I would give it a B at the moment, with scope for more in future.\n\nThe only elephant in the room is the size. OK, so this isn't the phone's fault and I knew what I was getting, but don't kid yourself that it's anything other than a big phone. I picked up my old N5 the other day and, frankly, it still feels the \"right\" size for a phone.

Found out about the bootloop of death and poor battery later.  Still work with my Nexus 7 2012 3G and N7 2013 LTE.  They're still serviceable \nwith custom ROM's.  Took a trial with a Blu Studio G Plus and got it rooted with one of the \"commercial\" mods I think King Root or something like that.   Am afraid to do a custom ROM as no one can find stock ROMS that are \neasily accessible for BLU stuff I can trust.  It was a $49.00 phone so no big deal.  Still works.  The Nexus stuff is straight forward to root and that's why I went with the 6P.  Don't know if I would have bought it if I was aware \nabout the \"issues\" that that's o.k.\n\nWell after upgrading adb on my Linux laptop (the old Ubuntu stock adb didn't have fastboot) , I got the boatloader unlocked and rooted..  Then stuck the 8.1.0 OPM 5.17-xxxx latest in and it works fine. Rooted with Magisk. Well that was simple.  Am doing a battery run and seeing how it performs.  I haven't had any issues yet and do like it.  Am prepared to deal with the bootloop but I guess the new stock ROM probably has that addressed.  It's nice and I take pride in seeing how well some of the old hardware performs with updated ROMs.  Sheesh the N7 2012 3G is a little slow at loading up XSDL/GnuRoot and the linux program Xastir but once it gets going, it's pretty decent.  The N7 2013's do a bit better with speed even though they are old.\n\nOnce I do some run tests I'll determine whether or not the battery needs a changeout.  Am like others that I don't want to lay out big $$$$$$ that the purveyors of this \"heroin-ware\" engineer to be disposable once something gives out.\n(ie. an involved battery swap out on the 6P)  I've swapped batteries out on my other Nexus tablets with little difficulty but the 6p is a little more involved.

Going up I didn't use the phone except for checking the weather and saw something like 1.5% per hour.\n\r\nSo far this morning at work, where I usually hardly use the phone at all, I'm seeing something like 1.9% per hour just occasionally turning on the screen to check for texts/e-mails (SoT so far, 4 hours into my day is about 45 minutes). The best my Note 5 EVER did, impersonating a brick on my desk, was maybe 3.5% per hour.

I spent about 15 minutes playing with the camera last night before and 15 minutes after installing Nougat and noted a huge amount heat being generated with the resultant power consumption of over 15% in just those few minutes. I get that the processor is working hard on processing  but this is one area the Note 5 is better. While the 6P is so much more efficient overall than the Note 5 (running MM), I use the camera a lot while traveling and occasionally for work, and I'm worried that it will so dramatically reduce it's endurance that it'll die on me halfway through the day. I'm going to Singapore for a week next for a week and so far I don't think the 6P will be the phone I take only for this reason.

Just got it in the mail on Thursday June 16th. But, I have to say, the bare phone in hand feel is not great. I literally boxed it back up after playing with it that first day, and I'm not using it again until my new case arrives in the mail sometime next week (because it's so easy to drop because it doesn't feel right in the hand). The problem is that it's too thin (and wide, but the width is only a problem because its so thin)! After I get a case on it, I'm sure it's going to be 100% better in hand feel.

Before I explain: Most of the time I'm in areas where multiple networks are in range. My ISP also has WiFi spread out, which is good when stationary but not so good when driving and the phone can't hop WAPs fast enough nor does it give up trying...\n\nWhen connected to 5 GHz with a good signal and not many other networks in range: I get great throughput. This means WiFi often works very well at home. But the problems start when there is ambiguity about if the phone should connect to a particular network, or if it should fail over to the mobile network. \nFor example, there are times when it prefers the 2.4 GHz network for no apparent reason, instead of my usual 5 GHz coming off the same router. Other times it will prefer a distant 2.4 GHz network over either WiFi signal at home. I have to switch manually when I notice what is happening. \nSometimes it refuses to connect to the \"Saved\" network, despite showing a strong signal. I have to turn WiFi off and on, and try to connect manually to get back on track. \nIn areas with many networks in range, it won't connect to the preferred saved one if I don't select it and connect manually. If I'm really unlucky the saved network doesn't show on the list until I turn WiFi off and on a couple of times to force the list to refresh.\n\nBut what really bothers me is how Location Services gets less accurate with WiFi on. Waze falls behind if WiFi is enabled while driving. This happens in metro areas with at least a few networks in range. My Galaxy S7 was smarter about if and when to maintain spotty connections.
